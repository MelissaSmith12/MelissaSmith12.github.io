</footer>    <div class="section"><p>Last week <strong>LINK</strong>, I wrote about the </p>
<p>Goals need to be specific. It's not just enough to say that I want to sleep better or by healthier. Having quantified goals help me know when my habits are moving me closer to success. </p>
<p>I'll start with the easiest of the goals to quantify: sleep. Generally speaking, I want to be DONE with this current bout of insomnia. When I go to bed, I want to fall asleep within a reasonable time frame and get at least 8 hours of sleep, without completely screwing up my schedule because I, for example, couldn't fall asleep until four, so I slept until noon.</p>
<p>By the end of December 2019:
    Have an updated wind-down and bedtime routine that has me in bed by midnight, asleep by 12:30, and waking up no later than 9.
    Get an average of 8 hours of sleep per week.
    No more snooze alarm.</p>
<p>Health is a little harder to pin down. Weight and BMI are two mechanisms I could certainly use as measures of health, but I hesitate to have them as my only measurements. I can definitely influence my metabolism, but I can't directly control it. So I want to create goals that are a little richer. I searched for other health metrics and found this handy guide which seems like a good start.</p>
<p>https://www.insider.com/how-to-measure-health-2017-9</p>
<p>I've just been for my annual exam, complete with bloodwork, so I can rule out some of the goals listed in the article. And I've got the sleep goal covered up above. But there are three on the list that could definitely use some attention: Waist circumference and time spent moving. And I know I've been under hydrating after my workouts. Depsite the article's advice, I'm going to set a fixed intake goal. It's easier to track than a pee-chart. And I'm not sure the world really needs me to blog a pee chart.</p>
<p>By the end of December 2019:
    Reduce waist circumference by one inch.***
    Regularly fill all of the hourly movement slots on my Fitbit.
    Finish the second season of Zombies Run, including all side missions (42 missions total - ~3 runs per week)
    Start doing long runs again on Saturdays, at least 4 by December 2019.
    Weight-lifting goal to be determined next time we meet with our trainer.
    Drink an average of, at minimum, 64 oz. water per day.</p>
<p>So that leaves the most nebulous goal for last: developing a functional schedule. This one's a bit murky, and it may need to evolve over time. I know that I want to be scheduled enough that I keep my commitments to other people and can close up my computer at the end of the day, knowing that I've kept my commitments to myself. But I also want the freedom to take a full or partial day off when it suits me, not just because the calendar says it's a Saturday. And most importantly, I need some sort of structure so that I don't get overwhelmed by the quantity of choices about how I might spend my time (more on that sometime in the next month).</p>
<p>I did some quick poking around on the internet, and there's plenty of tips out there for time management for freelancers, but nothing that quite addresses what I need. They reiterated things I knew or have tried in the past, like controlling for distractions and keeping bullet journals.</p>
<p>One of the things I've struggled with is that there are infinite ways I could organize my schedule. Also, I'm an owl and my husband is somewhat of a lark. There's something about my brain that lights up when it gets dark outside. My husband could give you an earful about my perpetual habit of starting deep conversations at around 10 pm. Going to sleep around one is a compromise of sorts.</p>
<p>Getting my sleep schedule back in order will help anchor whatever schedule I create. </p>
<p>By the end of 
    Keep a bullet journal to focus my day.
    Restrict my phone game-playing so that it's always paired with another activity.
    Get into rhythm/system/schedule for house cleaning, tidying, and maintance.
    Understand and write down what rhythm keeps me happiest and most fulfilled.
    Revisit and quantify this goal at the end of October.</p></div>
