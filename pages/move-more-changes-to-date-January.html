<p><h1 id="knee-to-chest-stretches" align="center"><strong>Knee-to-Chest Stretches</strong></h1></p></p>
<p>Step 1: Lie on your back. <br/>
Step 2: Pull your knees up towards your face so that your thighs are resting against your chest. Reach your arms around your shins and give your legs a hug. Alternatively, if doing both legs at once doesn’t work for you, you can pull one leg at a time to your chest. 
 <br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>The Reminders</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Put a sticky note on your alarm/phone.</li>
<li>Change your alarm text.</li>
<li>
<p>Change your alarm to a specific song that will remind you. Some silly possibilities include: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Back in Black (AC/DC)</li>
<li>I Won’t Back Down (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers)</li>
<li>Looking Out My Back Door (Creedence Clearwater Revival)</li>
<li>Get Back (The Beatles)</li>
<li>Baby Got Back (Sir Mix-A-Lot)
<br/></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br/><h1 id="back-and-shoulder-stretch" align="center"><strong>Back and Shoulder Stretch</strong></h1></p>
<p>Stretch your shoulders and back every time you stand up from a chair -- not a bed, car, or toilet. Just chairs and sofas!</p>
<p>Step 1: While standing, relax your shoulders and clasp your hands behind your back. <br/>
Step 2: Gently pull your hands away from your back.
 <br/><br/>
<strong>The Reminders</strong></p>
<p>When you do this stretch, soak it in. Give your brain the opportunity to get hooked on how good it feels.<br/></p>
<ol>
<li>Set alarms on your phone for times when you know you’ll be sitting, like when you're watching TV in the evening. Take some extra standup sessions to help yourself get into the habit.</li>
<li>At home, put some sticky notes on doorways you frequently walk through after you stand up. At work, put a sticky note on your monitor.</li>
<li>When you’re sitting down to work, set a timer. Maybe you only have a bit of time before your next meeting. Maybe you’ve got the whole afternoon ahead of you, but it makes sense to schedule a short break in an hour.</li>
<li>Lastly, if you’ve got a kiddo at home, enlist them as your accountability buddy. Ask them to gently remind you to stretch if you stand up and start walking away without stretching.</li>
</ol>
<p><br/><h1 id="countertop-push-ups" align="center"><strong>Countertop Push-ups</strong></h1>
Step 1: Stand in front of your kitchen counter, placing your feet together and your palms on the counter. The farther your feet are from the counter, the harder the push-up will be, so stand close to your counter!</p>
<p>Step 2: Holding your arms close to your body, bend your elbows and lower your body to the counter. Keep your back straight. Then push with your arms to raise your body back to the position in Step One.
 <br/><br/>
<strong>The Reminders</strong></p>
<p>You'll need to customize your reminders based on how your routines in your kitchen work. Possibilities might include:<br/> 
1. Put a note where you keep your coffee/tea/ mugs or on the kettle/coffee machine itself so you're reminded while you wait for your coffee to brew or for the kettle to boil.<br/>
2. Put a note on your stove, microwave, or toaster to remind you to do pushups while you’re boiling water for pasta or eggs, toasting bread, or microwaving your soup.<br/>
3. Put a note next to your recipe to remind yourself to do push-ups in between steps for a recipe. For example, if you’re supposed to stir your stir fry occasionally, then do a couple push-ups (instead of grabbing your phone).<br/></p>
<p><br/><h1 id="chair-pose" align="center"><strong>Chair Pose</strong></h1></p>
<p>Today we’re adding a variation of chair pose every time you wash your hands. Depending upon how your sink is configured, if you find that you have to strain to reach the soap or water, then you might need to do chair pose AFTER your hands are soapy.</p>
<p>https://www.yogaoutlet.com/blogs/guides/how-to-do-chair-pose-in-yoga</p>
<p>Stand with your feet and legs together and your arms out in front of you. Then squat as if you are sitting in a chair, making sure to keep your back straight but not stiff. Squat as deeply as your body (or your pants!) allows. We'll work our way towards having our thighs parallel to the floor.
 <br/><br/>
<strong>The Reminders</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Put a note on your bathroom mirror.</li>
<li>Put a note on your soap dispensers.</li>
</ol>
<p><br/><h1 id="shake-things-up" align="center"><strong>Shake Things Up!</strong></h1></p>
<p>When was the last time you cranked up the stereo and danced? What if dishwashing is your excuse to shake your groove thing?</p>
<p>I’ve put together a fun, ridiculous Spotify list to get you started. 
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/16XVkLCVOXvyrtoWsFPwdn
 <br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>The Reminders</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>First off, take a practice run real quick.</li>
<li>Stick a note eye-level at your sink.</li>
<li>If you're like me and don't have the best of dishwashing habits, set yourself an alarm. Bonus points if the playist is your alarm.</li>
</ol>
<p><br/><h1 id="box-breathing" align="center"><strong>Box-breathing</strong></h1></p>
<p>This method is called box-breathing because it’s a four step process.<br/></p>
<ol>
<li>Inhale slowly for four seconds.</li>
<li>With your lungs full of air, hold your breath for four seconds.</li>
<li>Exhale slowly for four seconds.</li>
<li>With your lungs empty, hold your breath for four seconds. 
<br/>
Give it a few practice runs, trying to breathe by expanding your diaphragm, not your chest. If box breathing makes you a little light-headed, experiment with dropping one of the breath-holding steps, making it triangle breathing. While you’re box-breathing, take a moment to notice the rest of your body. Are your shoulders tense? Have you been clenching your jaw? When you exhale, relax those areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9445-diaphragmatic-breathing
 <br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>The Reminders</strong></p>
<p>Go ahead and slap a sticky note on your phone at night to remind you to practice box-breathing with your morning back stretch.</p>
<p>But the real treat will be incorporating it into the rest of your day. It’s a fantastic tool for beating stress, used purportedly by Navy SEALs. So take a look at the week ahead, and identify points on your work and personal calendar when you know you’re likely to be stressed, anxious, or cranky.

<ul>
<li>That dentist appointment you’re dreading.</li>
<li>After (or during!) that weekly meeting that manages to hit all your rage buttons.</li>
<li>When the kids are running off steam after school, bouncing off the walls.</li>
<li>Any political current event storms onto your TV or Facebook feed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Schedule some calendar or phone reminders to yourself to practice some box-breathing.</p>
<p><br/><h1 id="it-band-stretch" align="center"><strong>IT Band Stretch</strong></h1></p>
<p>The Iliotibial (IT) Band is a piece of fascia that runs along your outer thigh, connecting your hip to your knee. It gets a lot of abuse (especially if you run) and not a lot of love. If you’ve ever felt a sharp, stabbing pain along the outside of your leg, that’s your IT band yelling at you. And if you’ve ever had a tight IT Band and had a massage, you might have levitated off the table when they massaged it.</p>
<p>https://www.medicinenet.com/iliotibial_band_syndrome/article.htm</p>
<p>Step 1: Standing with your legs together, cross your right foot over your left foot.
Step 2: Bending your right leg slightly, tilt your hips to the left. You should feel a stretch on your outer left leg.</p>
<p>Repeat by crossing your left foot over your right and tilting to the right. </p>
<p>Hint: You don't really have to remember which way to tilt your hips. It's nearly physically impossible to tilt them the other direction. Just try it once, and you'll see what I mean!</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>The Reminders</strong></p>
<p>This stretch is our chance to get some sneaky stretching done in public, whenever we’re standing around. Anytime you’re in a line is a great opportunity to do this stretch. Here’s a few ideas to get you started:<br>
- In line at the grocery store: write IT BAND at the top of your grocery list in big red letters
- Pumping gas: tape a note to your steering wheel
- In airport security and waiting to board the plane: print your boarding pass and write IT on the back in bright (but not alarmingly noticeable!) letters
- While you’re proctoring a test (that requires you to stand and circulate): Set a phone alarm between bells to remind you to stretch.</p>
<p><br/><h1 id="jaw-stretch" align="center"><strong>Jaw Stretch</strong></h1></p>

<p>Many of us clench our jaws when we’re stressed, which can lead to tension headaches and other kinds of misery. We're going to add a really easy stretch, every time we do box-breathing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Touch your tongue to the roof of your mouth.</li>
<li>Keeping your tongue on the roof of your mouth, as you inhale and hold your breath for your box-breathing, slowly lower your jaw as much as you comfortably can.</li>
<li>As you exhale and hold your breath for your box-breathing, slowly close your jaw.</li>
<li>Repeat. </li>
</ol>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>The Reminders</strong></p>
<p>Since we’re adding this to our box-breathing exercises, we just need to update those reminders to include these stretches. </p>
<p>Here are some silly suggestions for updating your morning alarm to include a song: </p>
<p>The Jaws theme</p>
<p>Get Back - Ludacris</p>
<p>Jawbreaker - Judas Priest</p></p>
