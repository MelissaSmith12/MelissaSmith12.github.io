Basically, see the instructions in this resource: https://spapas.github.io/2013/10/07/pelican-static-windows/

I renamed pelrun to pelgeneratecontent

## Usage

```powershell
pip install pelican
.\pelgencontent.bat # dev server, or maybe just a build watcher
.\pelpub.bat # run a build
.\pelserve.bat # serve the build
```
