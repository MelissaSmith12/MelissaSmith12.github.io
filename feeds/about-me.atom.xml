I love helping people make huge leaps in growth or productivity by implementing changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a lifelong learner who continues to be curious about the world and what makes people tick. I fuel my passion for learning by regularly participating in Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and listening to a ton of different podcasts, including Happier, Disgraceland, Stuff You Should Know, Futility Closet, Freakonomics, 99% Invisible, and The Knowledge Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My inquisitive nature serves me quite well as a data scientist. Anomalies and outliers can be fascinating, or they can be blips that happen with such little frequency that they're not worth anyone's time. I love getting an understanding of the business rules to help know when to keep digging and when to keep moving.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="habit coaching"></category><category term="data science"></category></entry></feed>
