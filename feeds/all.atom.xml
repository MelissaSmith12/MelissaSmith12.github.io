Every potential client …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I would love to help you make changes to your life in ways that suit your personality, while minimizing frustration, shame, and self-defeat. Change isn't always easy, but together we can craft strategies that help you swim with the current of your life instead of against it.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Every potential client receives a free one-hour introductory session. Before the call, I'll send materials for you to complete to organize and communicate your goals, identify times you’ve been motivated and times you’ve struggled in the past, and what you feel is most likely to slow your progress. During the call we’ll talk through the changes you want to make and coordinate what level of service might best meet your needs. Following the introductory call, I’ll send follow-up information including notes on our discussion and two simple strategies for you to try. And based on our call, I'll send a proposal for our sessions, based on the fierceness of your goals, the level of support you need, and your availability.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
The tiers below illustrate how I generally structure my coaching. The price shown is per session, and most people find that meeting once per week gives them the support they need. But these tiers are only the starting point. Together, we'll customize a plan that works for you. For example, for some people it works best to schedule two Accountabiliy and Coordination sessions per month with Self-directed Support in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th width=33%&gt;Self-directed Support&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th width=33%&gt;Accountability and Coordination&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th width=33%&gt;Premium Coaching&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;$30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;$75&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;$150&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;30-minute session&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1-hour session with follow-up&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1-hour session with daily follow-up for one week&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;For people who need a sounding board, but can provide their own accountability&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;For people who need more guidance to form and maintain their habits&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;For people with aggressive goals or for whom change is especially difficult&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&amp;bull; After each session, you email your plan for the week based on our session.&lt;/br&gt;&amp;bull; You track your long-term progress towards your goals.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&amp;bull; After each session, I email a recap of the week's plan.&lt;/br&gt;&amp;bull; I send links to relevant resources.&lt;/br&gt;&amp;bull; I provide resources for long-term tracking.&lt;/br&gt;&amp;bull; You send questions/issues mid-week to prepare for the next session.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&amp;bull; All support provide in the Accountability and Coordination tier plus daily check-ins and troubleshooting via text or email&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

I love helping people make huge leaps in growth or productivity by implementing changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a lifelong learner who continues to be curious about the world and what makes people tick. I fuel my passion for learning by regularly participating in Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and listening to a ton of different podcasts, including Happier, Disgraceland, Stuff You Should Know, Futility Closet, Freakonomics, 99% Invisible, and The Knowledge Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My inquisitive nature serves me quite well as a data scientist. Anomalies and outliers can be fascinating, or they can be blips that happen with such little frequency that they're not worth anyone's time. I love getting an understanding of the business rules to help know when to keep digging and when to keep moving.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="habit coaching"></category><category term="data science"></category></entry><entry><title>What is a Data Scientist?</title><link href="https://www.datasmithing.com/data-scientist.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-01T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Melissa Smith</name></author><id>tag:www.datasmithing.com,2019-07-01:/data-scientist.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Data scientists collaborate with business leaders and domain experts to unravel the mysteries and insights buried within an industry or company’s data.

We build models to generate predictions based on patterns, and we assess how well those models perform as your data grows and the world around us changes.&lt;/p&gt;

They let us autopilot towards goals, happiness, health, and fulfillment. But what happens when you have trouble setting habits? What happens when you have challenging goals that push you far out of your comfort zone and into familiar patterns of overwhelm, distraction, avoidance, or self-defeat? What happens when you have goals you know you NEED to pursue but you don't really WANT to pursue? What happens when you keep getting distracted from your goals by the hustle and bustle of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where I can help you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm so much more than an accountability partner or cheerleader. I'll actively listen to what's keeping your success out of reach. We'll solve problems around your goals and habits and run weekly experiments to find out what does and doesn't work for your individual needs. We'll start building momentum towards your goals and have a ton of fun along the way. Contact me at melissa@datasmithing.com for more information.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
