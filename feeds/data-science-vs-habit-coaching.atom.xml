At their heart, they involve asking deep, challenging questions to fully understand the dynamics of whatever problem needs to be solved. In each case, I analyze events or behaviors and use insights from those patterns to increase success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science uses past and present patterns to predict future behavior. With habit coaching I analyze past patterns and circumstances to understand how we might adapt your environment or strategies to disrupt and radically change your success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being involved in both keeps my analysis and problem solving skills sharp. And it keeps those analyses grounded: it’s easy to get buried during analysis, to lose sight of the bigger picture. But habit coaching constantly reminds me that while the analysis is helpful, if it doesn’t help us move towards actionable change, then it’s just navel gazing. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="habit coaching"></category><category term="data science"></category></entry></feed>
