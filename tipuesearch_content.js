var tipuesearch = {"pages":[{"title":"About","text":"About Me Melissa Smith is the sole owner, content creator, habit coach, and occasional programmer at DataSmithing. I use my talents and experience in problem solving, productivity, and my own neurodivergent lived experience to coach my clients to maximize their potential while minimizing friction. That's productivity-speak for \"stop being perpetually frustrated because you can't seem to succeed at your life's passion without burning out.\" But I am not a proponent of toxic productivity or positivity. Instead, my mission is to help you find joy and happiness in life by pursuing your strengths and your interests, by find out which strategies work for you and which ones just result in you tripping up again and again. Willpower isn't the answer. Together, we'll adjust your approach and your environment. My Neurodivergence My autism means that I'm wired to be direct, open, and honest. That means I won't shroud my message in euphemisms, and I'll dive right into getting to know you and the problems you face. My experience of life as neurodivergent – with others making it abundantly clear that I march to a different beat – means that I'm compassionate about your vulnerabilities and perceived shortcomings. Finally, I am intensely curious, and both problem solving and lateral thinking are my super powers. No issue is too niche or too mundane for us to troubleshoot together. My ADHD means that I've been studying productivity and neuroscience forever, trying to figure out what makes human brains tick (including my own) and figuring out how to compensate for my own struggles with concentration, executive functioning, motivation, and anxiety. It also means I read and study across a wide field of topics, so I can bring analogies and articles that are meaningful to your situation. I believe we are all innately pretty dang great. But we struggle and stumble when we try to be someone we're not, try to use methods that fit someone who is wildly different from us, or have an environment that actively or passively conspires against us. In addition to helping you identify strategies and modifications for your environment, I'll understand your strengths and super powers to help you navigate, outsource, and delegate issues and tasks that are your kryptonite, not just so you can be more productive, but so you can be happier and less stressed. I've lived a life full of trying to be someone that I\"m not. I fiercely believe I can help my clients escape similar traps.","tags":"misc","url":"pages/about.html","loc":"pages/about.html"},{"title":"What is a Habit Coach?","text":"Habits are the building blocks of so many aspects of our lives. They let us autopilot towards goals, happiness, health, and fulfillment. But what happens when you have trouble setting habits? What happens when you have challenging goals that push you far out of your comfort zone and into familiar patterns of overwhelm, distraction, avoidance, or self-defeat? What happens when you have goals you know you NEED to pursue but you don't really WANT to pursue? What happens when you keep getting distracted from your goals by the hustle and bustle of life? That's where I can help you! I'm so much more than an accountability partner or cheerleader. I'll actively listen to what's keeping your success out of reach. We'll solve problems around your goals and habits and run weekly experiments to find out what does and doesn't work for your individual needs.

These kinds of lists are serviceable at best and at worst can be defeatist, paralyzing, and a recipe for failure. They fail spectacularly when you struggle with decision fatigue, prioritization, or when you feel torn between tasks you really want to do and tasks you hate but feel like you OUGHT to do. Why am I so passionate about to-do lists? The short answer is that I spent 40+ years with undiagnosed ADHD, struggling to figure out how to get myself organized and focused. Sometimes this was pretty easy. I'm an optimizer. Give me a pile of time and physical constraints, and I'll be massively productive. But if you gave me an 8-hour uninterrupted block of time, it often meant I would make a list; get overwhelmed, demotivated, and defeated; and then waste the entire day. It wasn't until I was diagnosed with ADHD that I began to understand why I get stuck in this cycle. It's not a mark of failure, immaturity, or laziness. I just need some scaffolding to help ease the executive functioning load on my brain so I can succeed with less frustration. My ADHD diagnosis also gave me insight into how emotional dysregulation can be at the root of struggling to get things started and finished. We need help managing our boredom, dread, disgust, sadness, and discomfort. And it's not just people with ADHD who need this support. Anxiety, depression, grief, burnout, huge life changes, and the ongoing struggle of coping in a global pandemic can all impact our ability to process our emotions which, in turn, impacts our motivation and ability to focus. In my own struggle, I initially felt that there must be One True Answer. One perfect format that suited me. I found plenty, but they never worked for very long. But of course, they weren't The Answer for several reasons, primarily because my mental needs fluctuate, so I'm simply not going to settle into a rhythm that always works. Life, circumstances, and internal and external stressors change, so it absolutely makes sense that a one-size fits all solution just isn't realistic. This series is about finding the right structure for your day's energy, focus, and level of executive functioning as they fluctuate based on your stress level, sleep quality, anxiety, outside disturbances, and much more. I'll present not just how each format works, but also WHY it works. At the end of the series, I'll conclude with a handy guide so that you can easily match your struggle with the right kinds of scaffolding. I'll kick things off next post with a quick overview of why your motivation gets hijacked and some other foundational issues you may have encountered in the wild.

It's still cooking; no risk of whatever the newsletter equivalent of food poisoning from serving half-baked ideas. Nope. I don't want to spoil the day after the weirdest Labor Day ever. (Happy Labor Day, btw). Instead, let's get a head start on the Halloween season by talking about the potential horrors of remote work. Lately, I've seen a lot of articles about the dangers and pitfalls of working from home and being socially isolated. What's missing from those articles is usually the specifics and nearly always some solutions. I'll tackle this issue in the next couple of newsletters. First, let's look at some examples of how this social isolation might play with your perceptions in the workplace. We're evolved to be social creatures. We are considerably less social when working remotely, unless our companies have a great remote work culture. If we're cut off from people physically, our brains can start to freak out a little bit. While we logically understand what's going on, our little caveman brains that depend upon social structures can start to create all sorts of destructive stories about what's going on. Here's just one example of what can happen when we're separated from our co-workers: Everyone else's struggle is invisible. When you don't see your co-workers throughout the day, you miss hearing them grumble about how their project isn't going well or that client who's hard to manage. Simply put, you've lost some channels of information that tell you you're not alone in whatever you're struggling with. Your problems can feel unsolvable and uncommon. Here's some other examples that stem from having incomplete information: Everyone else's work looks effortless. No else has a learning curve. Everyone else is slacking off. Conversely, I'm slacking off and everyone else is working really hard. Person X isn't doing any work. You probably get the idea at this point. Our brains can be really bad judges of what's going on, especially if they feel like we've been cut off from the herd. We are the lone antelope surrounded by imaginary lions. Now, let's talk about some solutions! It's not all doom and gloom, I promise. There's a way out of the darkness. Generally speaking, one of the big problems we have is that we have less information to disprove our confirmation biases when we're isolated. Confirmation bias is our human tendency to give heavier weight to evidence which confirms our existing theories and disregard or downplay evidence which might disprove it. This is a helpful shortcut usually -- it saves us having to re-prove gravity every single day. Confirmation bias helps us make sense of the world -- it serves an evolutionary purpose. But what happens when the idea that gets stuck in your head is one that causes you a huge amount of anxiety such as, \"I'm going to lose my job if things don't change.\" That sort of thought is almost as unshakeable as it is miserable; your brain will do all sorts of mental gymnastics to disregard evidence to the contrary. So here's the short term way out. Step 1. Give your amygdala a big old dose of validation for whatever it is that's bothering you. A couple of weeks ago, I talked about amygdala days, where your brain's emotional centers take control and cut off or seriously impede your brain's access to the higher order thinking skills in your pre-frontal cortex. Skills that, well, many of us get paid to access these days. Our amygdalas HATE it when we aren't truly listening to them. And sometimes that just makes them dig their heels in further (or more insidiously, e.g. mega insomnia). The key to unclench your amygdala's hold is to validate what it's feeling, even if other parts of your brain are screaming that your amygdala is dumb and illogical. Tell those judgey parts of your brain to hush up for a minute (or we will NEVER get the amygdala to calm down). These two articles about validation really resonated with me a couple of weeks ago, and they can explain much better than I can how to validate someone else. So read them if you have a chance… and then use them on yourself. It will go something like this. \"Oh, amygdala. It's terrifying to think about losing your job. No wonder you're so worried and anxious.\" And your amygdala will say, \"OMG. Thank you. Yes, I am so exhausted from being worried. I'm going to go take a nap and rest, okay?\" I mean, it may not play out exactly like that, but seriously, there is enormous relief in just validating what your amygdala has been jumping up and down about at 3 AM trying to warn you about. Right, so while your amygdala is napping and catching its breath, you can proceed to step two. Step 2. Figure out the logical fallacies that were at play. So what was going on with that confirmation bias? How did your brain develop its weirdo, fringe conspiracy theory based on two facts with no context and the remote work rumor mill? Behold, this list of cognitive distortions holds the keys to what went awry. Now that our amygdala is snoozing, examining the list of cognitive distortions can help us see the world differently and perhaps even see that alternate views of our situation might even be more believable or potentially likely enough to ward off 3 AM existential crises. That's it for the short-term steps. We'll talk again about some long term steps to help guard against the pitfalls of remote work.","tags":"Posts","url":"hidden-dangers.html","loc":"hidden-dangers.html"},{"title":"When Your Prefrontal Cortex is Closed For Business Due to the Pandemic","text":"Bear with me while I set a bit of context for today's topic. First, let's talk about executive functioning. That's the set of skills you use to make decisions, prioritize, and plan your morning, your day, and your life. Maybe you have some days where you are absolutely on fire, knocking important things off your to-do list, left and right. And maybe you've got other days where you can barely make out your to-do list, much less make progress on it. Hold onto that thought while I veer off for a little more context. I'm working with a startup that's developing emotional intelligence apps for kids (and adults, as applicable) with disabilities, particularly kids on the autism spectrum. One member of our group is Dr. Christie Sosnowski-Bowen , a fantastic child psychologist who has specialized in kids on the spectrum but sees all sorts of kids in her private practice. A side benefit of having a psychologist in our group is that we're all able to speak a little more openly about our own struggles, especially throughout COVID. A couple of weeks ago, I was describing some issues I was having with my executive functioning, and Dr. Christie dropped some knowledge that completely changed my perspective. She can explain in much better than I can, but I'll give it an oversimplified whirl. That executive functioning ability? That's controlled by the prefrontal cortex portion of your brain, nestled right up next to your forehead. You've also got a part of your brain called the amygdala which handles emotions and motivation. The amygdala is, uh, responsive. Very responsive. And bossy. It takes over when the stakes are high, cutting your prefrontal cortex out of the picture. So when you're having a crap day where every decision seems to take a monumental amount of effort, your amygdala has taken control of your brain's steering wheel. Pandemic-related grief, anxiety, and fear or just being on the receiving end of an internet troll, all of these things can send your amygdala running to the rescue and taking over control. And let's just say the pandemic and American politics have got all our amygdalas running back-to-back marathons. So how are you supposed to tackle work while your amygdala is fired up… again? Here are three strategies to get you through your Amygdala Days. There's plenty more we could talk about, but if you're having an Amygdala Day, then more than three strategies are going to short-circuit you. Outsource your Executive Function. Buddy up with a coworker (or your spouse, in a pinch) and ask them to point you towards a single item on your to do list. When you've finished that one, ask for another, and so on. Repay the favor when they have an Amygdala Day. You and your buddy should also help break massive tasks (i.e. prepare the quarterly report) down to some manageable substeps. This may sound hokey, but my spouse directed me to do things on my list on Saturday, and it was one of the best days I've had in ages. Ah, the glorious freedom to not have to decide what to do. Roll the dice. This is an especially good strategy for weekend days, but it may also help on work days. Make yourself a numbered to-do list and then roll dice (or use a virtual dice roller ) to pick which item to work on. The underlying assumption here is that the order in which you do things doesn't really matter… it just matters that you get started so that you're not paralyzed by indecision. Narrow your focus to three tiny things. I've covered this strategy before in the newsletter about working when you're anxious and distracted. This is a great strategy when you know WHAT you should be working on, but you can't get your mind to settle enough to start focusing. So break off three tiny things that would move your project forward. They can be as easy as ‘Bold list headings'. They just need to be easy enough that you can tackle them. It's sort of like creating a breadcrumb trail in front of you to get yourself out of the forest. Just stay focused on the breadcrumbs. When you've done two or three, add more. Keep your list short so you never get overwhelmed, and you'll be out of the forest in no time.","tags":"Posts","url":"prefrontal-cortex.html","loc":"prefrontal-cortex.html"},{"title":"When Remote Work is a Literal Pain in the Neck or Back","text":"It is easy to accidentally spend the entire day curled over your laptop, typing away at your latest documentation manifesto. Or to have a million stressful chats, emails, and phone calls which leave your shoulders up by your ears. Your body will yell at you when you do these things. Here's some tips on keeping the back, shoulder, and neck pain at bay. Improve your office ergonomics. Are you craning your neck to look at your monitor? Take some time to reconfigure your desk so that your computer and keyboard are at the proper levels for your body. Check out these two links if you need help. Take stretch breaks. The joy of working from home is that no one can see you when you get up from your desk and roll around on the floor between conference calls. So go ahead and downward dog as a reward for slogging through your email inbox. Use a foam roller. If your upper back is tense, that can impact both our lower back and your neck. To tide you over until you feel comfortable getting a massage, get a foam roller and massage your upper back as shown in this video from the Mayo Clinic. Identify what makes you tense so you can take evasive action. Maybe it's when your boss chats you. Or maybe it's after you present at the weekly meeting. Pay attention to when your body yells at you. Then schedule some reminders to stretch and take breaks BEFORE you start hurting. Take a lunch break, preferably a walk. Just stepping away from your computer will help your neck and eyes. But taking a walk… maybe you wear a step counter and have noticed that working remotely makes it really easy to beat your lowest score. All that inactivity can begin to take its toll on your body, including your back. The more you can get moving during the day, the less your back will yell at you. Consider some ab exercises. If you're like me and your workout routine turned nearly non-existent at some unidentified point during the pandemic, then it could be that your back's hurting because it doesn't have the support of your six pack, four pack, or two pack anymore.","tags":"Posts","url":"remote-pain.html","loc":"remote-pain.html"},{"title":"Separation of Work and Personal: Don't Cross the Beams","text":"Today's message is pretty simple: don't use your work computer for personal business when you work from home. This may seem obvious, but I think it's important enough that it's worth reminding ourselves of it on a regular basis. When we're at home the lines get blurred. While you were at the office, you probably did the occasional bit of surfing here and there. Depending upon how your company runs its IT department, you might be monitored a bit more closely. Maybe they're not watching at all, but these are still good work computer hygiene habits to establish. Block social media sites in your browser. Consider blacklisting Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media sites that you're tempted to browse when you get a little bored during work. I'm not saying you have to stay off the fun parts of the internet during work hours. Just don't do it on your work computer. I'm calling out social media sites in particular because they contain such personal information. Clear out your stored passwords. If you aren't already using a password vault like LastPass, I recommend it as a great way to generate and store unique passwords, all locked behind a single master password for your account. At the very least, removing the stored passwords from your browser will put a tiny barrier between you and a site that you haven't unblocked. Don't sign into your browser. Signing into your browser lets you access your bookmarks and saved passwords across your computers. Unless you love the idea of accidentally pulling up NSFW images during your next presentation, sign out now. Use your smartphone instead. Not only will this keep your browsing history private, but you can also establish the habit of taking a break from your desk while you're using your phone. Do a couple laps around your house or yard. Stretch your legs. Lastly, speaking of your smartphone, remove your work email from it. Retake your life off the clock. While we're all figuring out new boundaries between work and home, do yourself the favor of cutting this cord so that when you're off work, you're really off work.","tags":"Posts","url":"separate-work.html","loc":"separate-work.html"},{"title":"Calling in Sick","text":"It can be hard to figure out when to call in sick when you work from home. You don't have to worry about getting your co-workers sick, so you might be inclined to call in sick only under the most extreme circumstances, right? That, my friends, is one of the many reasons why work-life balance can be harder when you work from home. Maybe this kind of decision is easy for you, but it wasn't for me when I first began working from home. I always erred on the side of powering through at my own expense. Some food for thought before we get started: No one gives Perfect Attendance awards anymore. (If they do, their priorities are out of whack). You do not owe it to your job to give them all of the time that you don't feel like crap while you're sick. Taking a sick day may improve your reputation as a remote worker; it means that you take your commitment to doing quality work seriously. Consider taking the advice you would give a good friend or subordinate. If you are feeling sub-par, your work may also be sub-par. That does no one favors and could damage your reputation. I'm not feeling great myself, so you can judge for yourself whether I ought to have called in sick today! Push Through If You Only Feel \"Under the Weather\" and… You've got a significant deadline. You don't have PTO or sick days to spare. You have some easy tasks where you can phone it in for a day. You have some checks and balances in your process that can catch any mistakes that slip through. Consider Working Odd Hours to Catch Up If... Any of the above apply and... It is not a hardship to rearrange your schedule. The illness you have is predictable (i.e. allergies or the bug your family just had) and you'll be able to tell when to push and when to nap. Catching up later will not make you stressed out and sicker. Go Either Way If... You've got a low-grade fever. Concentrating on work is difficult but not impossible. Meds will alleviate many of your symptoms with tolerable side effects. Definitely Call in Sick If... You've got more than a one-degree fever. No quantity of naps or medicine will help you feel better. It is VERY difficult to concentrate. This work week is easy, but next week isn't. It is a Thursday or Friday. (You do not have to sacrifice your weekend by pushing through the week). Always Call in Sick If… You have more than a two-degree fever. You have significant \"gastrointestinal distress\" with output. You have pain that makes it impossible to concentrate. You make an Emergency Room visit. Even if it's a relatively quick visit, you're assuredly very stressed and probably need some aftercare. No one will fault you once you say, \"I need to go to the ER\", and they shouldn't need to know more details than that.","tags":"Posts","url":"sick-day.html","loc":"sick-day.html"},{"title":"Remote Culture Without a Petri Dish","text":"Straight to the punch today, let's dive right into some ways you can build a great culture for remote workers within your company. While Everyone is Still Remote Start remote office traditions. For many offices, there's a feeling of togetherness and camaraderie that keeps the team together and functioning through the hard times. Starting some remote office traditions will help alleviate some of the stress of these uncertain times, but they will also reinforce that feeling that the team is in this together. Ideas include: Silly hat Friday for all meetings Zoom background contests Zoom lunches where everyone has takeout to simulate weekday lunches Celebrate together. Find a way to honor people's birthdays and other events in ways that aren't generic. Send meaningful YouTube links. Collect favorite stories about your co-worker. Arrange a ridiculous surprise with the co-workers partner, roommate, or neighbor's co-operation. If you're all still relatively local, arrange for a social distanced marching band to wish them happy birthday from their front lawn during a meeting. Something big. Get creative. Consider the occasional, optional virtual Happy Hour. As onerous as these may be to the introverts among us, group social time is crucial. Consider a flexible format to these, with smaller groups. Perhaps just invite a couple of people you like but haven't talked to in a while. Start lunch-and-learns. Learning together helps build teams, and giving people a chance to lead a lunch-and-learn is a great way to let people shine. During the remainder of the pandemic, these lunch-and-learns can be invaluable ways to help your co-workers get through that list of problems you've identified in your research. They're also a helpful way to socialize while avoiding the dreaded small talk. Consider a company video series or channel. Remote work can be depersonalizing. People become talking heads, and it's especially easy for people who don't attend meetings together to forget the people behind the emails. Videos are an AWESOME way to help your co-workers resolve the issues you've uncovered, especially if they are technical. Yes, you could point your co-workers to an anonymous YouTube video that perfectly explains what they need to do. But you and your co-workers explanations will sink in better. Post-Pandemic If You Stay Remote While Others Don't Be prepared to speak up again and again for inclusion. Recruit your fellow remote workers so you can take a turn raising your hand. The people in the physical office will forget to include you. Often. That old cliche about \"out of sight, out of mind\" is true. It's not out of spite, just human nature. But you'll need to be prepared to remind them that you exist and need to be included. Establish an informal buddy system. You and your remote companions should set reminders to regularly check-in with a buddy in the office. They will be your lifeline to what's going on. They'll connect you to the office gossip, and they'll advocate for remote workers because of your connections. Start a #remote slack channel. As you now know, working from home brings its own challenges and rewards. Band together. If you've stayed remote while others haven't, it's entirely possible that the people who went back to the office weren't successful AT ALL at home. Get used to their jokes about pajamas and day drinking.","tags":"Posts","url":"remote-culture.html","loc":"remote-culture.html"},{"title":"10 tips for handling technical issues when you work from home","text":"Several people requested a post focused on technical support. There were lots of different questions covering many different platforms and needs. The specifics and details of peoples' conundrums were far more specific than I could handle. But I consider it my job to look for patterns and universals, and find them I did. So I'm hoping that the strategies I share below are useful regardless of your particular situation. Budget extra time for technical hiccups and practice runs While you're adjusting to performing your usual duties while working remotely, things will take longer. Remember that the rest of your team is probably struggling with this too (or facing different struggles involving tweens and/or Playstations). Remind yourself and everyone that this adjustment takes time. Everyone will be slower while they climb this learning curve. For new stuff, no one expects you to be an expert. If they do, they're a jerk and unreasonable (or they are up to their eyeballs in stress and distractions -- see tweens and/or Playstations). When you ask for help or stumble, say please and thank you, not sorry You may recall articles that circulated a few years ago about how some people apologize far too much. You are not inconveniencing people by asking for help. You're trying to spend your time as efficiently as possible for your organization. When you work on teams, you are expected to help one another which, by definition, involves asking for help. Practice saying things like, \"Thanks for your patience. Working from home is great except for the added tech support snafus, eh?\" This feels better to BOTH parties compared to \"Sorry for bothering you with this. I'll let you get back to what you were working on before I interrupted you.\" Ask for help Working remotely can make it feel like you're alone waging a war against your to do list and your computer. But you're not alone. If you're stuck and can't get yourself unstuck (or if it seems like it's taking longer than it ought), reach out to your team. Helping feels good, and so long as you're not constantly asking, they may appreciate the opportunity to help. And if you're usually the person other people ask for help, you can start calling in favors in return. Often people can help by asking YOU questions that trigger you to think about the issue differently. When you ask for help, if it's via email or Slack, remember to provide context and specific information for what you're doing. This makes it easier for people to help you. Screenshots are awesome, and I like the free software Jing for this purpose. You can use it to record videos too. Alternatively, you can ask someone to hop onto a quick meeting with you so that you can screen share. If your team is using Slack, consider creating a channel specifically for technical help. Lastly, your IT department DOES still exist. They might be overwhelmed, but you won't know until you ask. It could be you've encountered a common problem, and IT may already have developed a recommended solution. Share what you've learned If you figure out something that you think most people in your group will stumble across, be sure to share with interested people using whichever medium is most appropriate. Divide and conquer if everyone in the group is learning new tools If many people in your group are facing multiple technical hurdles, consider whether it will make sense to divide and conquer. For example, let's say your team is suddenly using Slack, Zoom, Google Docs, and Google Sheets to collaborate. For some, that might be an overwhelming number of new tools to learn at once. So suggest that each of your team members pick one of the four tools to really study: Read through the getting started guide, watch YouTube tutorials, and then be the expert for the team. This can help everyone in your department feel a little less overwhelmed. Google: not just for checking your symptoms at 1 AM You can ask Google very specific questions and usually hit the jackpot right away. For example, \"how to scan using hp deskjet 2652\" will return exactly what you need. Don't forget to check the videos if you understand things better with a walkthrough. Make sure you're not defining the problem too narrowly There might be another method at your disposal that would make problem solving easier if you slightly changed how you're defining the problem. Let's say your perceived need is for a coworker to scan a document and send it to you. They've got a printer/scanner, but they rarely use it and they are running low on patience today. Would a photo be an acceptable substitute? Let's say your co-worker takes that photo, but you need a PDF, and your home computer doesn't have the fancy copy of Adobe that you need. You think, ‘aha, let me search for how to convert this JPG to PDF.' If you google ‘Convert JPG to PDF', you get nothing but results for possibly disreputable software. But if you can mentally zoom out and google ‘easy ways to convert a file to PDF', you'll find articles about using ‘Print to PDF' in MS-Office (as well as some Mac-based solutions). Chrome also lets you print to PDF. Or let's say you're writing a newsletter (hi!) and your Monday and Friday posts are super long (guilty!). In fact, they are so long that Gmail truncates part of your email. And that means you no longer get nifty statistics from your newsletter platform and one morning you wake up thinking that only two (TWO!) people read your email. You could write shorter emails (but leave out presumably valuable content), edit the email content so that it contains all the info with fewer words (and probably sounds as interesting as an encyclopedia entry), or switch newsletter platforms to one that was smart enough to design around this issue (sounds time consuming). Each of those solutions above? They solve the question: How can I make my emails shorter so that my platform gives me the feedback I crave and adore? But if I change the question to ‘how can I get the statistics I need and still give my readers the same content?', then the answer becomes clear: send an overview newsletter and post the extended version on my website. If you're stuck and can't think of a way to broaden the problem, take a break and come back to it. Take a walk. Work on something else. Or ask a coworker to be your sounding board. If you run into a roadblock, verify that it really needs solving… by you If you run into a significant roadblock, always reach out to confirm with whomever is requesting the work. Consider the following circumstances you might uncover: Since they first contacted you, the deadline changed or the project was cancelled entirely The request was a ‘nice-to-have' not a ‘have-to-have' piece of the project, and it's completely acceptable to not include that piece The requestor can very easily send the information in a different format that is 1000% more manageable The initial request was a curiosity, not a need. Since it's trouble, you can drop it entirely All of these things are worth finding out before you invest your company's time or (more importantly) your energy on solving the problem. If you're hosting a webinar or livestream, recruit an admin All web conferencing software has a chat ability that people can use to ask questions (and horse around). Have you had the pleasure of being in a meeting where the person leading the meeting is also keeping one eye on the chats as they are trying to talk? It's like watching a live PSA for not texting while driving. They might as well be doing vodka shots every slide of their presentation. Recruit an admin. They'll wrangle the chat area so that you can focus. That could involve the following: Providing technical support to people who aren't connecting Using the interface to mute people with disruptive audio Answering clarifying questions that you've already covered Keeping track of the questions, organizing them, and sending them to you during the question period of your talk, or raising them immediately, as appropriate Pay it forward (or backwards) If you've got that one co-worker or friend who always helps you out of your technical jams, offer some sort of treat for their help. That person could be playing IT support for lots of people right now. Here are some ideas to pay it back or forward: Offer some virtual babysitting by playing a game over webcam with their kids Order them a Yum box subscription (provided they don't have dietary restrictions) Order them a gift delivery or curbside from their favorite local restaurant or bakery. You can surprise them by collaborating with their partner or roommate to figure out their tastes Send them a YouTube playlist to brighten their day","tags":"Posts","url":"tech-issues.html","loc":"tech-issues.html"},{"title":"Repurpose your Commute","text":"Today I want to talk about commutes. The wonderful thing about working from home, of course, is that you've reduced your commute time to less than five minutes. But commutes are valuable parts of the day by helping: maintain a boundary between work from home so that work doesn't overrun your home life you transition from work to home keep your entire day from blurring together by separating it into distinct parts So, let's keep the routine of a commute, but substitute something way more enjoyable than rush hour traffic. Before we get into the specifics of what you commute could include, let's breeze through the parts of your routine that AREN'T your commute. Morning Keep your pre-commute morning routine roughly similar to what it was before Then do your morning community activity Keep your ‘getting to work' routine roughly the same. Don't forget to take some time to connect with your co-workers on your company Slack (or other tool of choice) Evening Tidy your work area. Make notes of where you left off. Note any priorities for tomorrow. Close everything up. You're DONE . Do your evening commute routine. Some of the example ‘commutes' below you might find better for the morning and others the evening. I highly recommend picking at least one exercise ‘commute' per day. Not only will it keep your mental health stronger during these stressful times, but it will help keep you healthy in the event you catch COVID-19. Listen to yourself and understand what you need at the end of the workday. Don't force, for example, a social commute if you're wiped out from meetings that day. Exercise Take a walk, listening to podcasts, music, or audiobook similar to your normal commute Kick a ball around in the yard with your kids Find a 15-20 minute exercise routine on YouTube and repeat it daily Walk or drive to the park (with your sanitizer) and play for a bit Go for a run, bike, or dust off that exercise equipment that's grown a little lonely Do a no-equipment HIIT workout like this one Peaceful Meditate using an app like Headspace or Insight Timer Take a shower or bath Brew a cup of tea and sit outside with a book Color Social Schedule a phone call or webcam conversation with a friend for each day of the week Start an actual email thread with an old friend Call an older relative of friend that you haven't spoken to in ages Throw a virtual happy hour on Fridays Fun Start playing a new game on your phone Play hide and seek with your kids, partner, or housemates Play video games with your family and friends Crack open a jigsaw puzzle (also great for conference calls!) Have a dance party in your living room Brainy Work on learning a new language using an app like Duolingo Listen to a podcast like Futility Closet or Stuff You Should Know Solve a Sudoku, crossword, or other brain puzzle Sign up for a free course on something that's always interested you on Coursera Creative Play that instrument you've been neglecting Crochet, knit, or sew Build a model or play with legos Draw or paint At this point, you should have enough ideas to find whatever will make for a pleasant commute that scratches some sort of itch that your work doesn't.","tags":"Posts","url":"your-commute.html","loc":"your-commute.html"}]};
