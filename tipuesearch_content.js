I use my talents and experience in problem solving, productivity, and my own neurodivergent lived experience to coach my clients to maximize their potential while minimizing friction. That's productivity-speak for \"stop being perpetually frustrated because you can't seem to succeed at your life's passion without burning out.\" But I am not a proponent of toxic productivity or positivity. Instead, my mission is to help you find joy and happiness in life by pursuing your strengths and your interests, by find out which strategies work for you and which ones just result in you tripping up again and again. Willpower isn't the answer. Together, we'll adjust your approach and your environment. My Neurodivergence My autism means that I'm wired to be direct, open, and honest. That means I won't shroud my message in euphemisms, and I'll dive right into getting to know you and the problems you face. My experience of life as neurodivergent – with others making it abundantly clear that I march to a different beat – means that I'm compassionate about your vulnerabilities and perceived shortcomings. Finally, I am intensely curious, and both problem solving and lateral thinking are my super powers. No issue is too niche or too mundane for us to troubleshoot together. My ADHD means that I've been studying productivity and neuroscience forever, trying to figure out what makes human brains tick (including my own) and figuring out how to compensate for my own struggles with concentration, executive functioning, motivation, and anxiety. It also means I read and study across a wide field of topics, so I can bring analogies and articles that are meaningful to your situation. I believe we are all innately pretty dang great. But we struggle and stumble when we try to be someone we're not, try to use methods that fit someone who is wildly different from us, or have an environment that actively or passively conspires against us. In addition to helping you identify strategies and modifications for your environment, I'll understand your strengths and super powers to help you navigate, outsource, and delegate issues and tasks that are your kryptonite, not just so you can be more productive, but so you can be happier and less stressed. I've lived a life full of trying to be someone that I\"m not. I fiercely believe I can help my clients escape similar traps.","tags":"misc","url":"http://localhost:8000/pages/about.html","loc":"http://localhost:8000/pages/about.html"},{"title":"What is a Habit Coach?","text":"Habits are the building blocks of so many aspects of our lives.

Its companion piece, How Executive Functioning Impacts Tidiness , explains the underpinnings of difficulties with tidying. Each step in The Graph Paper Method is intentional, and I encourage you to explore the context that post provides. Overview You're going to draw a map of the horizontal surfaces in your home and color in small areas of progress on your map every day that will correspond to real world progress in your home. This map lets you easily see that you're carving out progress, even if it's hard to see in the rooms themselves. It reduces the pressure to figure out where to start: all you have to do is keep plugging away and you will progress. Tidying in this case means putting objects away where they belong, throwing away trash, neatly arranging anything that permanently lives on the surface, folding blankets that live on the sofa, and so on. Essentially, it means returning a surface to its ideal, orderly state. It does not have to mean cleaning and dusting the surface. Setup Pick the room or rooms in your home where you want to begin your tidying journey. Starting with a room where you spend most of your time is a great beginning. Using a sheet of graph paper (or plain paper if graph paper isn't handy or printable), sketch a two-dimensional, view-from-above floor plan of the furniture and objects that live permanently in the room. Exposed horizontal surfaces only – the objects that collect clutter. Here's an example drawing of my living room, with our blue couch, purple armchair, and assorted tables, shelving units, and TV trays. Decide on the minimum amount of time you'll tidy each day. Try to pick the longest amount of time that will still be easy and doable 100% of the time. Maybe this is 10 minutes. Maybe it is 2 minutes. Pick rewards. Reward yourself for starting your tidy habit, reward yourself while you're doing it, and when you finish it. All the rewards. We're changing a lifetime of habits here so pull out all the stops to keep yourself feeling good about this new habit. Set up reminders. Set a timer on your phone to remind you each day/evening to tidy a surface or portion of a surface. Put sticky notes in visible places you'll encounter at relevant, helpful times (e.g. the tv remote). Recruit a support system of friends and family to help reinforce the habit. If the people you cohabitate with aren't on board with tackling the tidying part with you, then ask if they'll DJ while you tidy. Or buddy up with a friend and text progress photos to one another. Daily steps Speak to yourself with gentle, kind intentions about this habit. Tidiness is hard, and it's okay that you need scaffolding and support around it. You deserve all the kindness, rewards, and encouragement while you build this habit. Each day, pick a surface in the room that you can completely tidy during the time range you've selected (e.g. 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes). Subdividing areas into multiple days is totally acceptable – heck, you can even divide up portions of the couch or definitely divide up portions of the kitchen counter. Incremental forward progress is the important part here. Include progress on the floor! Make sure the mental and physical energy you have available matches the surface you pick for the day. Be gentle and kind with what you ask of yourself. When your reminder chimes, tidy the bit of horizontal surface that you've selected. Color in this area on your sketch once you've completed it. In my example drawing of my living room, I highlighted a portion of the couch that I tidied, removing stray laundry and pads of paper. Perform a maintenance tidy of all the areas you have already colored in. The only items on the maintenance areas will be items you've used today, which hopefully makes the items relatively easy to put away. Long-term steps Keep tidying areas in your home until all the areas on your map are colored in. Draw an additional map to cover new rooms. This final example drawing shows progress after about a week, with multiple colored-in surfaces that are now tidy. Keep rewarding yourself for maintaining your routine. Switch up the rewards if your motivation begins to wane. If your tidiness slips, there could be two issues at play. You might need to mix up your rewards so that keeping the tidiness is more appealing. Or it might be a sign that other parts of your life are overwhelming or a bit too hectic. Consider that the tidiness is a sign of struggle and not any sort of personal failure. It's OKAY if your house gets messy again because now you've got an easy way out before it reaches critical mass. And that's it for the graph paper method. There's a fair bit of purpose and structure behind the method, and I invite you to explore that in the long version.

This article explains key components about why your neurodivergent brain struggles to keep your living space tidy and the methodology and support around start to build a neurodivergent-friendly daily tidyness habit. This article has a companion post, Building a Tidying Habit: The Graph Paper Method , which describes a method you can start today. Yes, it often appears that there's been a struggle in my home. My whole life I have struggled to keep my spaces neat and organized. Whether I was busy, burnt out, depressed, or just, you know, eight, I have struggled with the motivation, focus, and planning required to keep things tidy. Prior to my ADHD diagnosis, I thought my messiness was just a deep-seated character flaw. But with diagnosis came clarity, self-compassion, and the understanding that the clutter and untidiness are an outward manifestation of my executive functioning struggles. When I think back to how I struggled as a girl with undiagnosed ADHD, I have so much compassion for that little kid. I can see how all of it fits into my neurodivergent brain. Rarely would I play with just one set of toys in a play session, but I would pull out a lot of different activities in one afternoon, navigating between the activities when I got bored. The advice to \"put my toys away when I was done\" didn't compute because I was never done. That activity was just on hold while something else sparked my imagination. By the end of a play session, it looked like a chaos monster had entered the room. Spoiler alert: the chaos monster lived in the room. It is me. I am the chaos monster who whirls through the room, leaving destruction and unfinished projects in her wake. In addition to the chaos of my play habits, tidying took executive functioning skills that I just didn't have, doubly so if I was trying to clean because I was in trouble. Motivation is a perpetual struggle for people with executive dysfunction, and what kid is especially motivated for the chore of tidying? And lastly, tidying my room was a minefield of distractions. How could I put away the book on the floor when that book screamed, \"Read me!\"? Meanwhile, because of my autism and love for sorting and order, if you took me to a hardware store, I would tidy the endcaps. I'm sure it was maddening to observe this dichotomy. All of this is to say that the Graph Paper method I propose has succeeded for me, an ADHD, autistic adult who is not naturally equipped with the skills to keep a tidy home. This method is battle tested. Has it worked forever? No. But I'm increasingly embracing that my battle with order and chaos will be life-long – I have begun to accept, without judgment, that I have neat phases and messy phases, which are a pretty good barometer of my overall mental health, not a reflection of my character. The messy phases are a sign that I need more self-care and more support. The Graph Paper Method's goal is NOT to tidy your house as quickly as possible (that's why we invite guests over, after all) but to build a relatively sustainable, neurodivergent-friendly habit. You can read the method itself now or later if you like. The rest of this post gives background on habit formation, the neurodivergent brain, and how to proceed applying this method while healing any internal damage you've sustained by living a cluttered life. On Habit Building Creating habits can be difficult regardless of whether you are neurodivergent or neurotypical. New habits require change, and all our brains like what's easy and already familiar (i.e. our old behavior). So it takes planning, intention, and repetition to establish a new way of doing things. In other words, it takes some work and a little understanding of how to program new habits into our brains. Every habit needs three components: a cue, an action, and a reward. The cue is what reminds us to do the action, and the reward is what lights up our dopamine receptors so that we want to keep repeating the habit, day after day after day 1 . Cues need to be reliable occurrences, guaranteed to pop up so that the habit doesn't rely on us remembering to do it. Established routines are great cues, or you could use alarms on your phone. But you will need a reminder. Possibly several. Post notes where you will see them frequently so that this new habit is well advertised. Set calendar reminders so this new habit is top of mind. Whatever it takes. Our action is this new habit of tidying. Since tidying can be hard for the neurodivergent and making habits stick can be hard for everyone, we'll lower the barriers to tidying so that it's easy to be successful, every single day. That means that we'll start very small, with a time commitment that feels comfortable and achievable every single day, even on our busiest, tiredest of days. Consistency is how we make this habit stick. Our method will use some scaffolding to support our executive functioning when it comes to this tidiness habit so we can make tracking and seeing our progress much easier. And, lastly, there's the rewards. Our hungry little brains LOVE rewards. We love the dump of brain chemicals that get delivered with rewards, and we love the idea that we've earned a prize. The prize is what keeps us coming back for more. For some habits, we might not need any external, additional reward. But if you're reading this, it's probably because tidying has been a challenge, and so we'll need to make that reward extra sparkley. We are conditioning ourselves to love whatever new habit it is we're adopting, and for tidying, that is going to take A LOT of bribery. For neurotypical people, a reward at the end of the task might be sufficient to make a new habit stick. But people with ADHD can struggle with task initiation and autistic people can struggle with transitioning from one task to another. So rewarding ourselves for starting is a critical additional component. This also safeguards us from the familiar problems many of us have with delayed rewards: either talking ourselves out of even wanting the reward if it means that we have to do the task or decided that, heck, we make the rules and can reward ourselves without doing the task. On Executive Functioning: Why Tidying is Hard Executive functioning refers to a group of skills handled by the pre-frontal cortex portion of our brains. Many, many neurodivergent people struggle with the skills as well as kids who haven't developmentally grown into these skills yet. The table below lists executive functioning skills 2 and how struggles with those skills might manifest when one is trying to tidy. Executive Functioning Skill Example impact on tidying a messy room Planning and prioritizing Gets stuck at: Where should I start picking up? Organization of materials Difficulty deciding/maintaining specific places for storage of belongings. Time Management Struggles to realistically estimate how long it will take and start with enough time to finish. Working memory What was I working on before I picked up this shiny thing? Self-Monitoring and metacognition Accidentally spends a lot of time on minute, detailed work (e.g. organization of bookshelf) instead of overall tidying. Inhibition and impulse control Look at this cool thing I unearthed! falls into rabbit hole Emotional control Difficulty managing frustration and shame. Sustained attention Struggles to keep tidying when it is boring. Task Initiation Very hard to start tidying. So hard. Flexibility Struggles to accept partner's methods for tidying. Goal-Directed persistence Makes progress on tidying in short-term but struggles to maintain efforts in long-term. Stress tolerance Melts down during cleaning because it seems hopeless I'm just going to pause for a moment while you absorb the emotional impact of that heap of struggles. I sourced the list of executive functioning skills from a course I took, but the examples are high-quality, artisanal struggles from a lifetime of living with a neurodivergent brain. It is impossible for me to review that table without a flood of memories and echoes of criticism (that'd be the cPTSD talking). As you read that list, you may feel grief for agony endured or a flare of rage at having been expected to do the impossible without instruction, support, or scaffolding. And if that's the first time you've seen a list of executive functioning skills and are seeing your past through a whole new set of hindsight goggles, give yourself a moment. It's a lot to take in. Right. Back to the explanation. There are SO many moving parts involved with tidying and so many points where our executive function struggles trip us up. As with all spectrums that we encounter in neurodivergence, you may struggle with some of these skills and excel at others. You may find that even some strengths have vanished completely when you're stressed, tired, preoccupied, or under emotional duress. And, hoo boy, it can be very distressing to have your strengths vanish if you don't understand the role your amygdala plays in this. Our amygdala is one of the oldest parts of our brain, dedicated to guaranteeing survival and sensing fear. It is the center of our infamous fight or flight response (or more completely, flight/fight/freeze/fawn response). When we experience strong emotions and our amygdalas take over, our prefrontal cortex gets inhibited. As I remind my clients, if we are running away from a Grizzly bear, our brain knows we need to be focused on the bear, not developing and executing a project plan, so our amygdala takes over. It's a feature, not a bug. Humans who did not outrun the bear did not procreate, so our evolutionary history has favored this little almond-sized nugget of instinct. Of course, we rarely have interactions with Grizzly bears in our modern lives. But our amygdala can't tell the difference between fear from a Grizzly bear and the fear that we've lost our keys (again. today.). If we look at the task of tidying and cleaning through the lens of skills that make up executive functioning, it becomes clear that setting expectations for us to clean or tidy without significant support is a recipe of failure and crushing defeat. We need alternate systems and processes for tidying compared to neurotypicals. The same is true for those of us whose parents were absent and unable or unwilling to teach them how to be tidy in developmentally appropriate ways when we were young. Generally, and especially if we were late diagnosed, we may not have received adequate support and instruction as children. Specifically we may not have been taught how to tidy in ways that supported our neurodivergence or tidying may not have been taught at all. We may have been punished for not being able to perform this task which was far more complex and difficult for us than the adults in our lives realized. Tidying requires every single one of those executive functioning skills. Side note: If you are a partner, parent, or friend of someone with executive dysfunction, please recognize that even encouragement often sounds like pressure and expectations. And pressure and expectations will often backfire because they activate our amygdalas. We are not messy because we are lazy, inherently disorganized, vengeful, or stubborn. Being neat is a difficult skill for us. Hopefully this article has conveyed to you the complexity of the problem we face in trying to bring order to this external chaos. But there IS hope. Scaffolding and support can help us learn and adopt strategies that feel good and are (relatively) enjoyable to maintain. On trauma and shame Many, many neurodiverse people have experienced trauma related to their weirdness, including both their unusual strengths and skills and their atypical weaknesses. When I talk to people who struggle with tidiness, I hear echoes of judgments, bullying, and criticisms that they've accumulated over the years – echoes they repeat to themselves, perpetuating and compounding the initial shame. Shame feels terrible and gross. It's a punishment, and punishments create avoidant behavior. Why does shame lead to avoidant behavior? It activates our amygdala, first of all. Are we going to be punished for what we haven't done? Are we already being punished? Then run away. It's a classic flight response. The worse you personally feel about the untidiness in your home, the more likely you are to stay paralyzed about how to tackle it. So in addition to providing lots of positive reinforcement, we need to actively resolve the shame. We need to provide our internal selves with supportive, positive reinforcement. We need to heal. In addition to our external messiness, most of us have some pretty hefty internalized shame and self-criticism. It is a cesspool in there (in the shame pit, not in your living room). But we have the opportunity to disrupt that here. Every day when you perform this tidiness habit, it's a chance to intentionally change your internal dialog. Your inner dialog might try to \"help\" by turning a critical eye towards what you haven't done yet. Encourage your inner dialog to get curious about this new way that you're learning. This way has support and structure that was missing in the old way that you tidied. YOU aren't a failure. The old tidying system was, but that system is not you. On Overwhelm Personally, my ability to get overwhelmed is on a hair trigger. I struggle to figure out where to start, and in assessing where I COULD start, I really notice how messy things are, which kicks off the shame spiral. I feel defeated before I even start. This whole process HURTS. It is self-punishment, and it's critical to break this cycle that, of course, gets in the way of tidying, but more importantly, is a miserable way to live. In addition to feeling miserable, once we're overwhelmed, our access to our executive functioning withers. The Graph Paper Method takes care of some of the executive functioning for you by keeping track of what you've done already – even if it got untidy again as you went about your day. Each day you don't need to pick where to START; you only need to pick one very small area to actually tidy. Since we're chipping away day after day, it really doesn't matter what you pick. You'll hit all the areas eventually. So just pick what is easiest, either by the volume of objects on the surface or the ease of putting those objects away. If a surface is cluttered enough to kick off overwhelm, then divide that surface into portions that are not overwhelming. Tidy half of it – or a quarter. This method is very much focused on long-term success, so each day you make the task as easy as possible so that you keep doing it each and every day. Yes, your home will get tidied much more gradually than if you rallied to try to clean everything all at once. But by rewarding yourself for small amounts of work each and every day and maintaining that tidiness, you can minimize the chance of clutter relapse. Additionally, this method helps prevent overwhelm because the two-dimensional diagram a) visually simplifies the problem of tracking what you might work on b) keeps a record of your progress, eliminating the need for you to remember what surfaces you're committed to maintaining and c) clearly indicates progress – something your jerk of a brain may forget because it wants to focus on what you haven't tidied yet. ADHD and Habit Building and Rewards I cannot overstate how important it is to build satisfying rewards into the process for those of us with ADHD. We struggle with task initiation and motivation. Boring tasks are our arch nemesis. This method uses tiny, easily tackled, incremental change because we DO NOT WANT TO TIDY unless it is enjoyable. This reward business is NOT about feeling as if you need to earn nice things to enjoy them. There's no value judgment here. It is purely about habit formation. Rewards help make new habits sticky. For an easier habit, the glowing satisfaction of achieving the habit might be satisfying. But for tidying, we've got to pull out the big guns. In addition to the role the rewards play in habit formation, we're working to convince our brain that tidying isn't the horrible, miserable punishment of our past. Good things happen in the long term when we tidy – fewer lost items, less tripping and slipping on our stuff, and a calm, organized space. But we've got to sell our brains on the idea in the short term so we can get to the long term. The reward is a campaign to show our reluctant little brains that this tidying lark is okay – and there's no looming punishment. Some people will want rewards that are consistent, repeatable, and dependable. Embrace the ritual and routine. Soak up the joy of your reward, but consider switching your reward if the shine ever begins wearing off. If you respond best to consistency and ritual, then consider two or three rewards that you change weekly, monthly, or as-needed. Some people will benefit from rewards that are surprises with a tiny bit of mystery and suspense. Intermittent rewards will actually make the habit even stickier (think slot machines). Consider rolling a die after you tidy for an additional treat and rewarding yourself a prize based on your die roll: A piece of candy A song from your playlist of favorites Send a supportive, validating friend a snapshot of your progress graph or a selfie of you and your tidy area Sing yourself a ridiculous made-up song about the thing you just cleaned Put away one more thing. Roll again when you're done. Nothing. No reward. Tidy again tomorrow for another chance! Conclusion As I tell my clients, ultimately, it isn't that our neurodivergent brains are broken or imperfect. We're no more flawed than any other person walking the planet. But we may not have learned or adapted systems that fit our glorious brains. What works for us will be different. While it might seem that it's taking significant effort to rewire your systems to better accommodate you, it is worth it. And going forward, if you have neurodivergent children in your life, you can help them learn strategies early that will suit them their whole lives.

These kinds of lists are serviceable at best and at worst can be defeatist, paralyzing, and a recipe for failure. They fail spectacularly when you struggle with decision fatigue, prioritization, or when you feel torn between tasks you really want to do and tasks you hate but feel like you OUGHT to do. Why am I so passionate about to-do lists? The short answer is that I spent 40+ years with undiagnosed ADHD, struggling to figure out how to get myself organized and focused. Sometimes this was pretty easy. I'm an optimizer. Give me a pile of time and physical constraints, and I'll be massively productive. But if you gave me an 8-hour uninterrupted block of time, it often meant I would make a list; get overwhelmed, demotivated, and defeated; and then waste the entire day. It wasn't until I was diagnosed with ADHD that I began to understand why I get stuck in this cycle. It's not a mark of failure, immaturity, or laziness. I just need some scaffolding to help ease the executive functioning load on my brain so I can succeed with less frustration. My ADHD diagnosis also gave me insight into how emotional dysregulation can be at the root of struggling to get things started and finished. We need help managing our boredom, dread, disgust, sadness, and discomfort. And it's not just people with ADHD who need this support. Anxiety, depression, grief, burnout, huge life changes, and the ongoing struggle of coping in a global pandemic can all impact our ability to process our emotions which, in turn, impacts our motivation and ability to focus. In my own struggle, I initially felt that there must be One True Answer. One perfect format that suited me. I found plenty, but they never worked for very long. But of course, they weren't The Answer for several reasons, primarily because my mental needs fluctuate, so I'm simply not going to settle into a rhythm that always works. Life, circumstances, and internal and external stressors change, so it absolutely makes sense that a one-size fits all solution just isn't realistic. This series is about finding the right structure for your day's energy, focus, and level of executive functioning as they fluctuate based on your stress level, sleep quality, anxiety, outside disturbances, and much more. I'll present not just how each format works, but also WHY it works. At the end of the series, I'll conclude with a handy guide so that you can easily match your struggle with the right kinds of scaffolding.

It's still cooking; no risk of whatever the newsletter equivalent of food poisoning from serving half-baked ideas. Nope. I don't want to spoil the day after the weirdest Labor Day ever. (Happy Labor Day, btw). Instead, let's get a head start on the Halloween season by talking about the potential horrors of remote work. Lately, I've seen a lot of articles about the dangers and pitfalls of working from home and being socially isolated. What's missing from those articles is usually the specifics and nearly always some solutions. I'll tackle this issue in the next couple of newsletters. First, let's look at some examples of how this social isolation might play with your perceptions in the workplace. We're evolved to be social creatures. We are considerably less social when working remotely, unless our companies have a great remote work culture. If we're cut off from people physically, our brains can start to freak out a little bit. While we logically understand what's going on, our little caveman brains that depend upon social structures can start to create all sorts of destructive stories about what's going on. Here's just one example of what can happen when we're separated from our co-workers: Everyone else's struggle is invisible. When you don't see your co-workers throughout the day, you miss hearing them grumble about how their project isn't going well or that client who's hard to manage. Simply put, you've lost some channels of information that tell you you're not alone in whatever you're struggling with. Your problems can feel unsolvable and uncommon. Here's some other examples that stem from having incomplete information: Everyone else's work looks effortless. No else has a learning curve. Everyone else is slacking off. Conversely, I'm slacking off and everyone else is working really hard. Person X isn't doing any work. You probably get the idea at this point. Our brains can be really bad judges of what's going on, especially if they feel like we've been cut off from the herd. We are the lone antelope surrounded by imaginary lions. Now, let's talk about some solutions! It's not all doom and gloom, I promise. There's a way out of the darkness. Generally speaking, one of the big problems we have is that we have less information to disprove our confirmation biases when we're isolated. Confirmation bias is our human tendency to give heavier weight to evidence which confirms our existing theories and disregard or downplay evidence which might disprove it. This is a helpful shortcut usually -- it saves us having to re-prove gravity every single day. Confirmation bias helps us make sense of the world -- it serves an evolutionary purpose. But what happens when the idea that gets stuck in your head is one that causes you a huge amount of anxiety such as, \"I'm going to lose my job if things don't change.\" That sort of thought is almost as unshakeable as it is miserable; your brain will do all sorts of mental gymnastics to disregard evidence to the contrary. So here's the short term way out. Step 1. Give your amygdala a big old dose of validation for whatever it is that's bothering you. A couple of weeks ago, I talked about amygdala days, where your brain's emotional centers take control and cut off or seriously impede your brain's access to the higher order thinking skills in your pre-frontal cortex. Skills that, well, many of us get paid to access these days. Our amygdalas HATE it when we aren't truly listening to them. And sometimes that just makes them dig their heels in further (or more insidiously, e.g. mega insomnia). The key to unclench your amygdala's hold is to validate what it's feeling, even if other parts of your brain are screaming that your amygdala is dumb and illogical. Tell those judgey parts of your brain to hush up for a minute (or we will NEVER get the amygdala to calm down). These two articles about validation really resonated with me a couple of weeks ago, and they can explain much better than I can how to validate someone else. So read them if you have a chance… and then use them on yourself. It will go something like this. \"Oh, amygdala. It's terrifying to think about losing your job. No wonder you're so worried and anxious.\" And your amygdala will say, \"OMG. Thank you. Yes, I am so exhausted from being worried. I'm going to go take a nap and rest, okay?\" I mean, it may not play out exactly like that, but seriously, there is enormous relief in just validating what your amygdala has been jumping up and down about at 3 AM trying to warn you about. Right, so while your amygdala is napping and catching its breath, you can proceed to step two. Step 2. Figure out the logical fallacies that were at play. So what was going on with that confirmation bias? How did your brain develop its weirdo, fringe conspiracy theory based on two facts with no context and the remote work rumor mill? Behold, this list of cognitive distortions holds the keys to what went awry. Now that our amygdala is snoozing, examining the list of cognitive distortions can help us see the world differently and perhaps even see that alternate views of our situation might even be more believable or potentially likely enough to ward off 3 AM existential crises. That's it for the short-term steps. We'll talk again about some long term steps to help guard against the pitfalls of remote work.","tags":"misc","url":"http://localhost:8000/hidden-dangers.html","loc":"http://localhost:8000/hidden-dangers.html"},{"title":"When Your Prefrontal Cortex is Closed For Business Due to the Pandemic","text":"Bear with me while I set a bit of context for today's topic. First, let's talk about executive functioning. That's the set of skills you use to make decisions, prioritize, and plan your morning, your day, and your life. Maybe you have some days where you are absolutely on fire, knocking important things off your to-do list, left and right. And maybe you've got other days where you can barely make out your to-do list, much less make progress on it. Hold onto that thought while I veer off for a little more context. I'm working with a startup that's developing emotional intelligence apps for kids (and adults, as applicable) with disabilities, particularly kids on the autism spectrum. One member of our group is Dr. Christie Sosnowski-Bowen , a fantastic child psychologist who has specialized in kids on the spectrum but sees all sorts of kids in her private practice. A side benefit of having a psychologist in our group is that we're all able to speak a little more openly about our own struggles, especially throughout COVID. A couple of weeks ago, I was describing some issues I was having with my executive functioning, and Dr. Christie dropped some knowledge that completely changed my perspective. She can explain in much better than I can, but I'll give it an oversimplified whirl. That executive functioning ability? That's controlled by the prefrontal cortex portion of your brain, nestled right up next to your forehead. You've also got a part of your brain called the amygdala which handles emotions and motivation. The amygdala is, uh, responsive. Very responsive. And bossy. It takes over when the stakes are high, cutting your prefrontal cortex out of the picture. So when you're having a crap day where every decision seems to take a monumental amount of effort, your amygdala has taken control of your brain's steering wheel. Pandemic-related grief, anxiety, and fear or just being on the receiving end of an internet troll, all of these things can send your amygdala running to the rescue and taking over control. And let's just say the pandemic and American politics have got all our amygdalas running back-to-back marathons. So how are you supposed to tackle work while your amygdala is fired up… again? Here are three strategies to get you through your Amygdala Days. There's plenty more we could talk about, but if you're having an Amygdala Day, then more than three strategies are going to short-circuit you. Outsource your Executive Function. Buddy up with a coworker (or your spouse, in a pinch) and ask them to point you towards a single item on your to do list. When you've finished that one, ask for another, and so on. Repay the favor when they have an Amygdala Day. You and your buddy should also help break massive tasks (i.e. prepare the quarterly report) down to some manageable substeps. This may sound hokey, but my spouse directed me to do things on my list on Saturday, and it was one of the best days I've had in ages. Ah, the glorious freedom to not have to decide what to do. Roll the dice. This is an especially good strategy for weekend days, but it may also help on work days. Make yourself a numbered to-do list and then roll dice (or use a virtual dice roller ) to pick which item to work on. The underlying assumption here is that the order in which you do things doesn't really matter… it just matters that you get started so that you're not paralyzed by indecision. Narrow your focus to three tiny things. I've covered this strategy before in the newsletter about working when you're anxious and distracted. This is a great strategy when you know WHAT you should be working on, but you can't get your mind to settle enough to start focusing. So break off three tiny things that would move your project forward. They can be as easy as ‘Bold list headings'. They just need to be easy enough that you can tackle them. It's sort of like creating a breadcrumb trail in front of you to get yourself out of the forest. Just stay focused on the breadcrumbs. When you've done two or three, add more. Keep your list short so you never get overwhelmed, and you'll be out of the forest in no time.","tags":"misc","url":"http://localhost:8000/prefrontal-cortex.html","loc":"http://localhost:8000/prefrontal-cortex.html"},{"title":"When Remote Work is a Literal Pain in the Neck or Back","text":"It is easy to accidentally spend the entire day curled over your laptop, typing away at your latest documentation manifesto. Or to have a million stressful chats, emails, and phone calls which leave your shoulders up by your ears. Your body will yell at you when you do these things. Here's some tips on keeping the back, shoulder, and neck pain at bay. Improve your office ergonomics. Are you craning your neck to look at your monitor? Take some time to reconfigure your desk so that your computer and keyboard are at the proper levels for your body. Check out these two links if you need help. Take stretch breaks. The joy of working from home is that no one can see you when you get up from your desk and roll around on the floor between conference calls. So go ahead and downward dog as a reward for slogging through your email inbox. Use a foam roller. If your upper back is tense, that can impact both our lower back and your neck. To tide you over until you feel comfortable getting a massage, get a foam roller and massage your upper back as shown in this video from the Mayo Clinic. Identify what makes you tense so you can take evasive action. Maybe it's when your boss chats you. Or maybe it's after you present at the weekly meeting. Pay attention to when your body yells at you. Then schedule some reminders to stretch and take breaks BEFORE you start hurting. Take a lunch break, preferably a walk. Just stepping away from your computer will help your neck and eyes. But taking a walk… maybe you wear a step counter and have noticed that working remotely makes it really easy to beat your lowest score. All that inactivity can begin to take its toll on your body, including your back. The more you can get moving during the day, the less your back will yell at you. Consider some ab exercises. If you're like me and your workout routine turned nearly non-existent at some unidentified point during the pandemic, then it could be that your back's hurting because it doesn't have the support of your six pack, four pack, or two pack anymore.","tags":"misc","url":"http://localhost:8000/remote-pain.html","loc":"http://localhost:8000/remote-pain.html"},{"title":"Separation of Work and Personal: Don't Cross the Beams","text":"Today's message is pretty simple: don't use your work computer for personal business when you work from home. This may seem obvious, but I think it's important enough that it's worth reminding ourselves of it on a regular basis. When we're at home the lines get blurred. While you were at the office, you probably did the occasional bit of surfing here and there. Depending upon how your company runs its IT department, you might be monitored a bit more closely. Maybe they're not watching at all, but these are still good work computer hygiene habits to establish. Block social media sites in your browser. Consider blacklisting Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media sites that you're tempted to browse when you get a little bored during work. I'm not saying you have to stay off the fun parts of the internet during work hours. Just don't do it on your work computer. I'm calling out social media sites in particular because they contain such personal information. Clear out your stored passwords. If you aren't already using a password vault like LastPass, I recommend it as a great way to generate and store unique passwords, all locked behind a single master password for your account. At the very least, removing the stored passwords from your browser will put a tiny barrier between you and a site that you haven't unblocked. Don't sign into your browser. Signing into your browser lets you access your bookmarks and saved passwords across your computers. Unless you love the idea of accidentally pulling up NSFW images during your next presentation, sign out now. Use your smartphone instead. Not only will this keep your browsing history private, but you can also establish the habit of taking a break from your desk while you're using your phone. Do a couple laps around your house or yard. Stretch your legs. Lastly, speaking of your smartphone, remove your work email from it. Retake your life off the clock. While we're all figuring out new boundaries between work and home, do yourself the favor of cutting this cord so that when you're off work, you're really off work.","tags":"misc","url":"http://localhost:8000/separate-work.html","loc":"http://localhost:8000/separate-work.html"},{"title":"Calling in Sick","text":"It can be hard to figure out when to call in sick when you work from home. You don't have to worry about getting your co-workers sick, so you might be inclined to call in sick only under the most extreme circumstances, right? That, my friends, is one of the many reasons why work-life balance can be harder when you work from home. Maybe this kind of decision is easy for you, but it wasn't for me when I first began working from home. I always erred on the side of powering through at my own expense. Some food for thought before we get started: No one gives Perfect Attendance awards anymore. (If they do, their priorities are out of whack). You do not owe it to your job to give them all of the time that you don't feel like crap while you're sick. Taking a sick day may improve your reputation as a remote worker; it means that you take your commitment to doing quality work seriously. Consider taking the advice you would give a good friend or subordinate. If you are feeling sub-par, your work may also be sub-par. That does no one favors and could damage your reputation. I'm not feeling great myself, so you can judge for yourself whether I ought to have called in sick today! Push Through If You Only Feel \"Under the Weather\" and… You've got a significant deadline. You don't have PTO or sick days to spare. You have some easy tasks where you can phone it in for a day. You have some checks and balances in your process that can catch any mistakes that slip through. Consider Working Odd Hours to Catch Up If... Any of the above apply and... It is not a hardship to rearrange your schedule. The illness you have is predictable (i.e. allergies or the bug your family just had) and you'll be able to tell when to push and when to nap. Catching up later will not make you stressed out and sicker. Go Either Way If... You've got a low-grade fever. Concentrating on work is difficult but not impossible. Meds will alleviate many of your symptoms with tolerable side effects. Definitely Call in Sick If... You've got more than a one-degree fever. No quantity of naps or medicine will help you feel better. It is VERY difficult to concentrate. This work week is easy, but next week isn't. It is a Thursday or Friday. (You do not have to sacrifice your weekend by pushing through the week). Always Call in Sick If… You have more than a two-degree fever. You have significant \"gastrointestinal distress\" with output. You have pain that makes it impossible to concentrate. You make an Emergency Room visit. Even if it's a relatively quick visit, you're assuredly very stressed and probably need some aftercare. No one will fault you once you say, \"I need to go to the ER\", and they shouldn't need to know more details than that.","tags":"misc","url":"http://localhost:8000/sick-day.html","loc":"http://localhost:8000/sick-day.html"},{"title":"Remote Culture Without a Petri Dish","text":"Straight to the punch today, let's dive right into some ways you can build a great culture for remote workers within your company. While Everyone is Still Remote Start remote office traditions. For many offices, there's a feeling of togetherness and camaraderie that keeps the team together and functioning through the hard times. Starting some remote office traditions will help alleviate some of the stress of these uncertain times, but they will also reinforce that feeling that the team is in this together. Ideas include: Silly hat Friday for all meetings Zoom background contests Zoom lunches where everyone has takeout to simulate weekday lunches Celebrate together. Find a way to honor people's birthdays and other events in ways that aren't generic. Send meaningful YouTube links. Collect favorite stories about your co-worker. Arrange a ridiculous surprise with the co-workers partner, roommate, or neighbor's co-operation. If you're all still relatively local, arrange for a social distanced marching band to wish them happy birthday from their front lawn during a meeting. Something big. Get creative. Consider the occasional, optional virtual Happy Hour. As onerous as these may be to the introverts among us, group social time is crucial. Consider a flexible format to these, with smaller groups. Perhaps just invite a couple of people you like but haven't talked to in a while. Start lunch-and-learns. Learning together helps build teams, and giving people a chance to lead a lunch-and-learn is a great way to let people shine. During the remainder of the pandemic, these lunch-and-learns can be invaluable ways to help your co-workers get through that list of problems you've identified in your research. They're also a helpful way to socialize while avoiding the dreaded small talk. Consider a company video series or channel. Remote work can be depersonalizing. People become talking heads, and it's especially easy for people who don't attend meetings together to forget the people behind the emails. Videos are an AWESOME way to help your co-workers resolve the issues you've uncovered, especially if they are technical. Yes, you could point your co-workers to an anonymous YouTube video that perfectly explains what they need to do. But you and your co-workers explanations will sink in better. Post-Pandemic If You Stay Remote While Others Don't Be prepared to speak up again and again for inclusion. Recruit your fellow remote workers so you can take a turn raising your hand. The people in the physical office will forget to include you. Often. That old cliche about \"out of sight, out of mind\" is true. It's not out of spite, just human nature. But you'll need to be prepared to remind them that you exist and need to be included. Establish an informal buddy system. You and your remote companions should set reminders to regularly check-in with a buddy in the office. They will be your lifeline to what's going on. They'll connect you to the office gossip, and they'll advocate for remote workers because of your connections. Start a #remote slack channel. As you now know, working from home brings its own challenges and rewards. Band together. If you've stayed remote while others haven't, it's entirely possible that the people who went back to the office weren't successful AT ALL at home. Get used to their jokes about pajamas and day drinking.","tags":"misc","url":"http://localhost:8000/remote-culture.html","loc":"http://localhost:8000/remote-culture.html"},{"title":"10 tips for handling technical issues when you work from home","text":"Several people requested a post focused on technical support. There were lots of different questions covering many different platforms and needs. The specifics and details of peoples' conundrums were far more specific than I could handle. But I consider it my job to look for patterns and universals, and find them I did. So I'm hoping that the strategies I share below are useful regardless of your particular situation. Budget extra time for technical hiccups and practice runs While you're adjusting to performing your usual duties while working remotely, things will take longer. Remember that the rest of your team is probably struggling with this too (or facing different struggles involving tweens and/or Playstations). Remind yourself and everyone that this adjustment takes time. Everyone will be slower while they climb this learning curve. For new stuff, no one expects you to be an expert. If they do, they're a jerk and unreasonable (or they are up to their eyeballs in stress and distractions -- see tweens and/or Playstations). When you ask for help or stumble, say please and thank you, not sorry You may recall articles that circulated a few years ago about how some people apologize far too much. You are not inconveniencing people by asking for help. You're trying to spend your time as efficiently as possible for your organization. When you work on teams, you are expected to help one another which, by definition, involves asking for help. Practice saying things like, \"Thanks for your patience. Working from home is great except for the added tech support snafus, eh?\" This feels better to BOTH parties compared to \"Sorry for bothering you with this. I'll let you get back to what you were working on before I interrupted you.\" Ask for help Working remotely can make it feel like you're alone waging a war against your to do list and your computer. But you're not alone. If you're stuck and can't get yourself unstuck (or if it seems like it's taking longer than it ought), reach out to your team. Helping feels good, and so long as you're not constantly asking, they may appreciate the opportunity to help. And if you're usually the person other people ask for help, you can start calling in favors in return. Often people can help by asking YOU questions that trigger you to think about the issue differently. When you ask for help, if it's via email or Slack, remember to provide context and specific information for what you're doing. This makes it easier for people to help you. Screenshots are awesome, and I like the free software Jing for this purpose. You can use it to record videos too. Alternatively, you can ask someone to hop onto a quick meeting with you so that you can screen share. If your team is using Slack, consider creating a channel specifically for technical help. Lastly, your IT department DOES still exist. They might be overwhelmed, but you won't know until you ask. It could be you've encountered a common problem, and IT may already have developed a recommended solution. Share what you've learned If you figure out something that you think most people in your group will stumble across, be sure to share with interested people using whichever medium is most appropriate. Divide and conquer if everyone in the group is learning new tools If many people in your group are facing multiple technical hurdles, consider whether it will make sense to divide and conquer. For example, let's say your team is suddenly using Slack, Zoom, Google Docs, and Google Sheets to collaborate. For some, that might be an overwhelming number of new tools to learn at once. So suggest that each of your team members pick one of the four tools to really study: Read through the getting started guide, watch YouTube tutorials, and then be the expert for the team. This can help everyone in your department feel a little less overwhelmed. Google: not just for checking your symptoms at 1 AM You can ask Google very specific questions and usually hit the jackpot right away. For example, \"how to scan using hp deskjet 2652\" will return exactly what you need. Don't forget to check the videos if you understand things better with a walkthrough. Make sure you're not defining the problem too narrowly There might be another method at your disposal that would make problem solving easier if you slightly changed how you're defining the problem. Let's say your perceived need is for a coworker to scan a document and send it to you. They've got a printer/scanner, but they rarely use it and they are running low on patience today. Would a photo be an acceptable substitute? Let's say your co-worker takes that photo, but you need a PDF, and your home computer doesn't have the fancy copy of Adobe that you need. You think, ‘aha, let me search for how to convert this JPG to PDF.' If you google ‘Convert JPG to PDF', you get nothing but results for possibly disreputable software. But if you can mentally zoom out and google ‘easy ways to convert a file to PDF', you'll find articles about using ‘Print to PDF' in MS-Office (as well as some Mac-based solutions). Chrome also lets you print to PDF. Or let's say you're writing a newsletter (hi!) and your Monday and Friday posts are super long (guilty!). In fact, they are so long that Gmail truncates part of your email. And that means you no longer get nifty statistics from your newsletter platform and one morning you wake up thinking that only two (TWO!) people read your email. You could write shorter emails (but leave out presumably valuable content), edit the email content so that it contains all the info with fewer words (and probably sounds as interesting as an encyclopedia entry), or switch newsletter platforms to one that was smart enough to design around this issue (sounds time consuming). Each of those solutions above? They solve the question: How can I make my emails shorter so that my platform gives me the feedback I crave and adore? But if I change the question to ‘how can I get the statistics I need and still give my readers the same content?', then the answer becomes clear: send an overview newsletter and post the extended version on my website. If you're stuck and can't think of a way to broaden the problem, take a break and come back to it. Take a walk. Work on something else. Or ask a coworker to be your sounding board. If you run into a roadblock, verify that it really needs solving… by you If you run into a significant roadblock, always reach out to confirm with whomever is requesting the work. Consider the following circumstances you might uncover: Since they first contacted you, the deadline changed or the project was cancelled entirely The request was a ‘nice-to-have' not a ‘have-to-have' piece of the project, and it's completely acceptable to not include that piece The requestor can very easily send the information in a different format that is 1000% more manageable The initial request was a curiosity, not a need. Since it's trouble, you can drop it entirely All of these things are worth finding out before you invest your company's time or (more importantly) your energy on solving the problem. If you're hosting a webinar or livestream, recruit an admin All web conferencing software has a chat ability that people can use to ask questions (and horse around). Have you had the pleasure of being in a meeting where the person leading the meeting is also keeping one eye on the chats as they are trying to talk? It's like watching a live PSA for not texting while driving. They might as well be doing vodka shots every slide of their presentation. Recruit an admin. They'll wrangle the chat area so that you can focus. That could involve the following: Providing technical support to people who aren't connecting Using the interface to mute people with disruptive audio Answering clarifying questions that you've already covered Keeping track of the questions, organizing them, and sending them to you during the question period of your talk, or raising them immediately, as appropriate Pay it forward (or backwards) If you've got that one co-worker or friend who always helps you out of your technical jams, offer some sort of treat for their help. That person could be playing IT support for lots of people right now. Here are some ideas to pay it back or forward: Offer some virtual babysitting by playing a game over webcam with their kids Order them a Yum box subscription (provided they don't have dietary restrictions) Order them a gift delivery or curbside from their favorite local restaurant or bakery. You can surprise them by collaborating with their partner or roommate to figure out their tastes Send them a YouTube playlist to brighten their day","tags":"misc","url":"http://localhost:8000/tech-issues.html","loc":"http://localhost:8000/tech-issues.html"},{"title":"Repurpose your Commute","text":"Today I want to talk about commutes. The wonderful thing about working from home, of course, is that you've reduced your commute time to less than five minutes.

Before we get into the specifics of what you commute could include, let's breeze through the parts of your routine that AREN'T your commute. Morning Keep your pre-commute morning routine roughly similar to what it was before Then do your morning community activity Keep your ‘getting to work' routine roughly the same. Don't forget to take some time to connect with your co-workers on your company Slack (or other tool of choice) Evening Tidy your work area. Make notes of where you left off. Note any priorities for tomorrow. Close everything up. You're DONE . Do your evening commute routine. Some of the example ‘commutes' below you might find better for the morning and others the evening. I highly recommend picking at least one exercise ‘commute' per day. Not only will it keep your mental health stronger during these stressful times, but it will help keep you healthy in the event you catch COVID-19. Listen to yourself and understand what you need at the end of the workday. Don't force, for example, a social commute if you're wiped out from meetings that day. Exercise Take a walk, listening to podcasts, music, or audiobook similar to your normal commute Kick a ball around in the yard with your kids Find a 15-20 minute exercise routine on YouTube and repeat it daily Walk or drive to the park (with your sanitizer) and play for a bit Go for a run, bike, or dust off that exercise equipment that's grown a little lonely Do a no-equipment HIIT workout like this one Peaceful Meditate using an app like Headspace or Insight Timer Take a shower or bath Brew a cup of tea and sit outside with a book Color Social Schedule a phone call or webcam conversation with a friend for each day of the week Start an actual email thread with an old friend Call an older relative of friend that you haven't spoken to in ages Throw a virtual happy hour on Fridays Fun Start playing a new game on your phone Play hide and seek with your kids, partner, or housemates Play video games with your family and friends Crack open a jigsaw puzzle (also great for conference calls!) Have a dance party in your living room Brainy Work on learning a new language using an app like Duolingo Listen to a podcast like Futility Closet or Stuff You Should Know Solve a Sudoku, crossword, or other brain puzzle Sign up for a free course on something that's always interested you on Coursera Creative Play that instrument you've been neglecting Crochet, knit, or sew Build a model or play with legos Draw or paint At this point, you should have enough ideas to find whatever will make for a pleasant commute that scratches some sort of itch that your work doesn't.","tags":"misc","url":"http://localhost:8000/your-commute.html","loc":"http://localhost:8000/your-commute.html"}]};
