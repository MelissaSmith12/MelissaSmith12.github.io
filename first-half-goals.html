</footer>    <div class="section"><p>I love New Year's Resolutions. The idea of a fresh start, hitting the reset button is so liberating to me. But I've always struggled with them. Not that I haven't achieved great things in a year, or had the accountability to stick through working on my resolutions for the whole year. But I have definitely had a couple that I have lugged across an entire decade with debatable success.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to shake things up in 2020 and become hyper-focused on finally, at long last, tackling those resolutions.</p>
<p>Here’s some specific strategies I’ve applied to help make this year’s version of ‘lose weight’ be more successful:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ditch the phrase ‘lose weight’ from my resolution.</strong> I can’t truly control whether or not I lose weight. What I <em>can</em> control is the habits I pursue that will very likely lead to weight loss. And ultimately, it’s not just weight loss I want but overall health and strength.</li>
<li><strong>Include specific dates on my habits, where appropriate.</strong> That gives me some deadlines and ways to achieve milestones of success along the way -- entirely within my control.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t try to do everything at once.</strong> This applies in two ways. First off, the deadlines give me a way to settle into all of the changes I want to make and slowly get to where I need to be. Slow, achievable changes are more successful. Secondly, for the very first time, I’ve actually limited my resolutions to single focus. I used to have a million each year, and they were ALL OVER the place. Not this year. I might DO the other things, but I’m not committing to doing them until I’ve tackled the first one.</li>
<li><strong>Make it fun.</strong> I’ve had some fun with how everything is worded. I’m launching many professional and personal projects this year, so I decided to make ‘launch’ a theme for this year. I grin every time I read my list.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here goes, here’s my official set of resolutions for the first half of 2020.</p>
<p>On June 30th, complete 10 pull-ups using bicep, tricep, and core strength following a lift-off using quadricep muscles.</p>
<p><strong>Decrease maximum payload for launch event:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Track nutrient consumption daily using MyFitnessPal or similar tracking system</li>
<li>Continue gym visits, increasing from 3x weekly to 6x weekly by the end of March.</li>
<li>Reintroduce intermittent fasting, experimenting with 10, 12, and 16-hour fasts to determine which best suits my body and lifestyle.</li>
<li>Give up refined sugar in January. Reintroduce in February, limited to 4x per month. Track using treat budget in Beeminder. </li>
<li>Weigh every morning after tooth brushing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Increase horizontal speed to achieve 3 miles in 30 minutes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create running and strength training schedule by January 15th to increase duration of running portion of weekly runs and gradually increase speed at achievable pace. I’m currently running 3 miles total at pace of 5.2 mph with a 0.1 mile walk break every 0.5 miles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improve chassis flexibility, balance, and durability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implement the tiny habit changes in my Move More 2020 Anti-Challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Increase maximum distance covered through rotational force:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Starting on February 1, ride exercise bike a minimum of one mile per day during morning wake-up game playing. Identify additional pairing events for biking. Track distance achieved per day. Beat maximum distance achieved 30 times.</li>
<li>Ride my non-stationary bike outdoors at least once.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Simulate launch maneuvers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Every Friday/Saturday gym session (depending on timing of trainer session), execute 50 squats, 5 minutes of planks, and 50 reps on compensated pull-up machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evaluate launch readiness on June 1st and consider additional initiatives for remainder of 2020.</p></div>
