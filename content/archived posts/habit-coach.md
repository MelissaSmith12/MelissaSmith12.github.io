Summary: Questioner, Data Scientist, Habit Coach

Habits are the building blocks of so many aspects of our lives. They let us autopilot towards goals, happiness, health, and fulfillment. But what happens when you have trouble setting habits? What happens when you have challenging goals that push you far out of your comfort zone and into familiar patterns of overwhelm, distraction, avoidance, or self-defeat? What happens when you have goals you know you NEED to pursue but you don't really WANT to pursue? What happens when you keep getting distracted from your goals by the hustle and bustle of life?

That's where I can help you!

I'm so much more than an accountability partner or cheerleader. I'll actively listen to what's keeping your success out of reach. We'll solve problems around your goals and habits and run weekly experiments to find out what does and doesn't work for your individual needs. We'll start building momentum towards your goals and have a ton of fun along the way. Contact me at melissa@datasmithing.com for more information.
