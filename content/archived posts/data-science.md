Data scientists collaborate with business leaders and domain experts to unravel the mysteries and insights buried within an industry or companyâ€™s data. We are curious and ask questions ranging from big-picture questions that clarify goals to detailed questions to guide analysis and understanding. We build visualizations to illustrate patterns or anomalies. We use statistics to analyze the impact of changes. We build models to generate predictions based on patterns, and we assess how well those models perform as your data grows and the world around us changes.
