&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's designed to be rigorous and intense and requires mastery of a massive chunk of prerequisite knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is not just academically difficult. It requires a level of focus, self-direction, self-management, and discipline that many students have not yet encountered. And there are new, more demanding roles that graduate students must learn to perform while juggling each role: student, TA, researcher, writer, advisee, spouse, partner, and/or parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many neurodivergent students love the intensity and subject matter but grapple with these increased demands on executive functioning skills. Many of us thrived in the structure of grade school, high school, and undergrad, only to be in a free fall in the vacuum of graduate school. It can become a vicious cycle: the pressure of graduate school builds stress that saps what executive functioning skills we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have, which of course creates more stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse yet, some students don’t fully understand that they’ve had lifelong struggles with executive functioning issues until they are mired in problems. Perhaps they are incredibly smart, which has always been enough to get them through their undergraduate exams, papers, and projects (sometimes with an extension or three). But graduate school brings these high pressure, competing roles that make prioritization so much more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of how executive functioning difficulties can impact graduate life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-collapse: collapse;
  padding: 5px
}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;div style="width:210px", border: 1px, black&gt;Executive Functioning Skill&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Example challenge for graduate students&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Planning and prioritizing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Difficulty balancing the roles and vague deadlines of advanced coursework, TA duties, independent research, and paper submissions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Organization of materials&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gets buried under a massive pile of source materials or undergraduate requests for help.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Time Management&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Starts the day intending to work on their thesis, but it somehow never happens.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Motivation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Trouble starting work for the day.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Self-Monitoring and metacognition&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Explores research rabbit holes that are fascinating but not especially useful.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Inhibition and impulse control&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gets distracted by every single office visitor and interruption.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Emotional control&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Difficulty managing frustration and shame around lack of perceived progress.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sustained attention&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Struggles to slog through tedious parts of research.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Task Initiation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Very hard to open the thesis document. So hard.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Flexibility&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;May struggle to pivot when a research idea fizzles out or advisor recommends a different direction.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Goal-Directed persistence&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Can’t… keep… thesising…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Stress tolerance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;May melt down because progress seems hopeless.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All too often it can feel like we "just aren't cut out for graduate school" or like it is a personal failure that we struggle so much with the calculus of competing roles and priorities. But scaffolding and support can decrease the pressure and make the challenges less isolating and more manageable. Connecting with other students with similar struggles can be incredibly reassuring, especially if it feels like all the other students in your program are time management wizards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurodivergent students are not deliberately self-sabotaging. We just need instruction and support to learn the unique tools and strategies that suit our magnificent, creative, and insightful brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my own miserable graduate school experience, I didn’t know I was autistic and had ADHD. I struggled and ultimately exited the program with a master's degree instead of being able to pursue a PhD. The experience rattled my self confidence, and my career has suffered for it. In the decades since, I’ve learned so much about my neurology and habits that could have helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to help other neurodivergent students succeed where I failed, so I am launching an online support program to share useful productivity strategies, provide structure and mini-commitments to make huge long-term goals manageable, and actively listen to help the current generation of students tackle today's problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are currently in graduate school or completing post graduate work, you are invited to participate in a free pilot version of an online support program for neurodivergent students. If you’re a professor or administrator who knows struggling students, please share this opportunity directly with your students. And please connect with me to build support for strugglng students across your university. My program will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regularly scheduled co-working hours with built-in rewards and opportunities to ask for help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An online Discord community where neurodivergent graduate students can connect with their peers to feel less alone in their struggles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Articles that teach useful strategies for navigating executive functioning problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support and tools for switching between the roles and rhythms of studying, researching, handling TA duties, writing, and sustaining a personal life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategies for reverse engineering your looming thesis project into manageable chunks that are easy to tackle each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentations and support sessions including experimenting with different time management tools and learning emotional regulation skills that underpin executive functioning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilot will run from Spring 2023 through the end of summer. If you are interested, please email Melissa@datasmithing.com. Please include the degree you are pursuing and describe one or two of the specific struggles you have. &lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes a session is just about being heard and validated. Sometimes it’s about learning new skills, coping mechanisms, and communication strategies. I often feel like my sessions are one-on-one tutoring sessions in emotional intelligence. But I struggle to take notes when I’m actively involved in a conversation, and it can be hard to remember everything I’ve learned in session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So whenever my therapist has external resources to share, I pounce on them. It really helps me know that there are other people in the world struggling with similar issues, and I can learn theories and skills at my own pace and a little more objectively (i.e. when I’m not immersed in my own issues). When I find great resources, I feel duty-bound to share them far and wide to whomever might need them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://therapistuncensored.com"&gt;Therapist Uncensored&lt;/a&gt; is one such resource. It is a long-running podcast and website hosted by Dr. Ann Kelley and Sue Marriott LCSW, CGP, two therapists from Austin, Texas, who describe their podcast as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learn to use the sciences of the mind to help you understand what makes you emotionally tick. Two Austin therapists and their world-recognized guest experts break down the research in modern attachment, rational neuroscience and trauma in a challenging but entertaining format to keep you off autopilot and moving towards closer connections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you've never been to therapy but are curious about some of the topics you've heard about here and elsewhere online. Maybe you are a lifelong learner who has wanted to do a deep dive ever since that intro course you took back in 1992. Maybe you’ve been in therapy for a while and would like the reinforcement that a podcast can provide. Or maybe you're on a waiting list for a therapist and want to start exploring and learning while you wait. Even if you’re a happy, securely attached grown-up who hasn’t yet worked with a therapist, their episodes cover fascinating topics that will help strengthen your relationship with yourself and with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been cherry picking from their catalog of almost 200 episodes. From the episodes I’ve enjoyed so far, these three episodes are great, useful episodes to download if you’re curious about subscribing: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://therapistuncensored.com/episodes/tu153-how-good-boundaries-actually-bring-us-closer-replay-with-juliane-taylor-shore/"&gt;TU153: How Good Boundaries Bring Us Closer - REPLAY - with Juliane Taylor Shore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; Interpersonal co-regulation requires boundary setting. Therapist uncensored co-hosts Ann Kelley and Sue Marriott join the founder of IPNB Psychotherapy of Austin, Dr. Juliane Taylor Shore, in a discussion on interpersonal neurobiology and regulation. We’ll explore the three types of boundaries, how to co-create them plus how to stay regulated using internalized relationships with the self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://therapistuncensored.com/episodes/tu154-conquer-shame-by-understanding-the-science-behind-the-feeling/"&gt;TU154: Conquer Shame by Understanding the Science Behind the Feeling, with Guest Expert Dr. Steve Finn – REPLAY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; Unpack the neuroscience of shame with Dr. Stephen Finn and co-hosts, Dr. Ann Kelley and Sue Marriott LCSW, CGP. It is probably one of your least favorite feelings, but it contains important interpersonal information for us and is a good one to deep-dive around. This is a replay from the archives, but is highly relevant today as nobody is feeling very good about themselves right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://therapistuncensored.com/episodes/self-criticism-169/"&gt;TU169: Sue and Ann Explore Self Criticism and Internal Scripts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; Hearing yourself criticized impacts your nervous system no matter if the voice is your own or someone else. Ann and Sue take a deep dive into self-criticism, self-attack, and internal criticism of others. They look at how it relates to attachment styles and use it as a window into unconscious scripts we carry about ourselves and the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So give them a listen and let me know if you learn anything about yourself. I would love to hear if you find episodes that particularly speak to you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this statement is factually true, it’s also an oversimplification and very linear explanation. Unpacking the details yields a story that is much more circuitous, which is entirely on brand for my experience with cPTSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s start at …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A painting created by penguin footprints triggered my cPTSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this statement is factually true, it’s also an oversimplification and very linear explanation. Unpacking the details yields a story that is much more circuitous, which is entirely on brand for my experience with cPTSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s start at the beginning. Ish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). People experience PTSD when they undergo or witness a disturbing event that gets stuck. They have trouble processing and resolving the incident, like a case of mental indigestion where the traumatic incident doesn’t get digested and… well, mental acid reflux happens. It’s unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a work experience that was traumatizing, and when I started having nightmares and relatively identifiable flashbacks, a stellar psychologist and friend nudged me towards a therapist who specialized in Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy for PTSD. Flashbacks, for the uninitiated, are moments when the present situation triggers one’s brain to time travel back to a past event. One feels as though now is the past – we relive the event as if it were happening right now. You feel flashbacks in your mind, your body, and your senses. Your brain stores a lot of sensory information with memories, and it’s common for our brains to think they are experiencing those same sensations once again. I went to therapy for a couple of months, but when the nightmares abated (but some insomnia started) my attendance dwindled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By and large the flashbacks, as I knew them, stopped after that first round of therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which again is… sort of factually true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I mostly recognized flashbacks from the way we see them in the movies. A soldier or veteran hears a car backfire, and they are immediately transported back to the war zone mentally. They may even dive for cover in the present day physical world from the gunfire and explosions being replayed in their minds. But PTSD isn't just limited to veterans. Any traumatic situation can cause it: car accidents, pregnancy loss, violent crime, and much, much more. 
My flashbacks are less linear or immediately recognizable. And they are complicated by two factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I am autistic. And one of the aspects of autism I experience is interoception issues, which are difficulties sensing and/or understanding signals from the systems inside one’s body. This includes physical sensations, such as sensing hunger or pain, and emotional sensations, communicated by the central nervous system. My interoception issues vary indirectly with the amount of external sensory input. Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep because once the lights are out and the world is quiet, I can finally hear what my body has to say and wow, does it have some complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I actually have complex PTSD (cPTSD), a relatively newly recognized subset of PTSD. It’s not in the DSM yet, and it certainly doesn’t get media coverage the way PTSD does. It derives not from a single event but from an extended period, or in many cases, a lifetime of events. In other words, PTSD comes from TRAUMA. It is a psychological blunt force wound. cPTSD comes from trauma, trauma, trauma, trauma. It comes from getting stabbing by a fork again and again and again. Or getting a psychological paper cut every hour of every day for years and years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us with neurodivergent brains also have cPTSD. We experienced emotional dysregulation that the adults in our lives may not have known how to handle (or even tolerate). Our weirdness was often met with chronic bullying from our peers. As my therapist recently explained it to me, the experience of feeling overwhelmed and alone again and again leaves scars. If we grew up feeling perpetually unsafe and hurt, those scars can accumulate into cPTSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because getting scars over and over hurts, our clever little brains figure out how to adapt so we can survive a new scar. They McGuyver a solution that sees us safely through the initial emergency when we’re kids, but using strategies that really aren’t durable for long term use. One of these strategies is dissociation. When you dissociate, you become numb, shutting down the emotional responses that make us all human. In the face of overwhelming feelings, as a kid, it might not have been safe to respond, especially at the level of intensity at which many neurodivergent kids experience them. Autistic and ADHD people often experience emotional dysregulation issues. Our amygdalas activate very, very quickly. Great for running from bears. Not great when the light bulbs are too loud and we can’t shut them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we develop an auto-shutoff switch for responding to things that make us feel threatened, furious, or devastated. Sometimes that switch stays activated until we’ve gotten ourselves somewhere safe and then we melt down. Sometimes the switch stays on and the feelings fester until we have burnout, anxiety, and depression. And sometimes the valve that keeps the feelings locked away leaks, and we wander around not being able to concentrate or focus and blame ourselves for not being productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is that the emotional energy we stuff down when we dissociate doesn’t just vanish. We don’t digest the experience, burp out our feelings, and move along to the next buffet. Nope. That energy gets stockpiled so that every time we’re triggered we feel the cumulative effect of all the other times we dissociated and stuffed down the feelings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this dissociation has made navigating flashbacks extremely tricky. Something triggers an emotional flashback, but my brain shuts down the feeling. I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; feeling. I’m walking around like an automaton, on autopilot, being a masked husk of my usual self. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I can’t feel the feelings, how do I figure out what’s happening? My feelings are locked up, but my thoughts are absolutely racing around, chasing one another across the dark corners of my memories. And observing my thoughts can finally, finally help me figure out what is going on and how to solve the mystery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember those &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/RcWxQUMLsLA"&gt;chase scenes in Scooby-Doo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, where the villain chased them through the doors in the hallway? The scenes were surreal, with rooms seemingly endlessly connected to one another, the chase sometimes reversing in the middle, and a catchy '60s pop song playing through the montage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what it is like for me, only every door reveals a different monster, a different memory. None of them on their own are insurmountable, but they glom together like an enormous self-criticism snowball monster. And I’m so busy running from the monsters to stop and figure out how to escape the endless loop and recycled scenery. I may not even realize I’m running because my prefrontal cortex is 100% inaccessible. I am living amygdala loca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cPTSD response feels like being frozen and stuck. I can’t tackle any tasks, no matter how much I might want to do them. I’m no longer in charge of my attention – if I so much as consider cracking open my laptop to, say, work on a blog post, then I’m immediately terrified of it. I see all the negative outcomes that might happen, none of the positives, and nothing can force me to begin even the easiest step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone with ADHD, the cPTSD inability to focus can be hard to spot. After all, ADHD means that focus is often in short supply. For me, there are three ways to spot the differences in how the lack of focus works: 
1) I have minimal control over the direction or speed at which my thoughts are moving, 
2) most, if not all, of my thoughts are negative and pack a concussive punch, and 
3) my train of thought keeps getting interrupted by memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If normal ADHD’s lack of focus is like a bumper car ride, then my cPTSD flashbacks are like being stuck in a bumper car that doesn’t work with an operator who isn’t stopping the ride and may be oblivious to the fact that my car is broken. I’m stuck, and I’ve got no choice but to wait it out while being knocked around by the other drivers, some of whom take aim at me, the sitting duck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy enough for me to identify those differences in theory. But it is so hard to figure out what’s going on in the middle. It’s like solving a mystery while blindfolded and drunk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how this weekend’s mystery worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday I impulsively bid on some items for an online charity auction at the shelter where I volunteer and where we got our beloved cat, Cora. Along with some other baskets of goodies, a canvas caught my eye with the bright blue footprints of Dwayne, the rockhopper penguin from the Cincinnati Zoo. Dwayne the penguin spoke to me, man, and so I bid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width = "400px"  src="/images/blog/dwayne's footprints.jpg" alt="A white canvas shows a pair of animal footprints in blue paint. These are the footprints of a rockhopper penguin. Each foot has three toes."&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My partner and I usually run big purchases past one another, especially optional ones. I didn't talk to him before I submitted my bids, but I did come clean in the hour in between when I voted and the auction ended. But he was understanding about it. I don’t usually splurge, and all-in-all it was not really a big deal between the two of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he went to bed and the show began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clue #1: I experienced an outsized response compared to the present reality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My husband and I had pretty immediately worked things out. In fact, there wasn't much to work out. He was kind and supportive throughout. The situation wasn't fantastic, but it certainly wasn't dire, and it was going to be easy enough to recover from the mistake. Plus, hey, it's a mistake that resulted in money for my favorite charity. That barely registers on the scale of mistakes I've ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penguin footprints. Really not a big deal, except in the sense that I’m pretty sure Dwayne is a Big Deal. But those are Dwayne’s issues, not mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of being excited about Dwayne’s imminent footprints, there I was, thinking I was a horrible person. I initially wrote ‘feeling’ there, but that’s not quite right. My internal monologue was full of messages about how irresponsible, impulsive, and selfish I was. I couldn’t have named a single feeling I was experiencing. “I feel like a horrible person” isn’t a feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clue #2: My thoughts/feelings weren't budging. If anything they were infecting anything else I thought about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stuck on the couch, rooted in place. I had a few things I wanted to accomplish the rest of my night, but for about two hours I could not nudge, push, or shove myself towards any of those tasks. Thinking about each of them kicked off what I can now see was more dread, shame, or guilt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My present self was so confused and frustrated about why this event that was no big deal is preoccupying me. I really wanted to tackle my three tasks. Really! I was motivated and everything! So why was I sitting there playing video games? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Ah, video games, the multi-tool of my life: I use them for fun, stimming, self-soothing, dissociating, and little rewards while I’m working on tough tasks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clue #3: My body was paralyzed into inaction, even for enjoyable tasks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuck. On the couch. Playing video games I wasn’t even enjoying. I &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to do the tasks on my list, but I just couldn’t budge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I realized I was functionally, if not literally, paralyzed, something finally clicked, and I realized I was not in charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mystery solved: cPTSD response.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the light bulb went off, I started to steer myself out of it. Realizing that I’m experiencing a cPTSD flashback means I can switch channels for a moment. 
I washed some dishes (one of my three tasks) and sang along to my favorite playlist, and once my capable adult brain was back online, I talked myself through recovering and resetting from the experience. Altogether, round trip, the flashback experience and recovery was about four hours. And believe it or not, that’s a huge improvement over past trips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my patient readers, now you understand the mystery of how something as innocuous as a set of penguin footprints can trigger cPTSD responses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be exhausted just reading this. I know I was exhausted living through the penguin mystery, writing about it, and living through the flashbacks that showed up when I remembered the events about four years ago that made me initially realize I was dissociating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope (and my condolences) is that if my description sounds nauseatingly familiar in ways you weren’t quite aware of yet, then this understanding gives you a springboard towards your own recovery. I hope my description helps you put the pieces together more quickly than I did. Healing all those scars and learning better tools for emotional regulation takes work. Damn hard work. But it is infinitely worth it, and beats the hell out of shaming yourself for reaching for yet another match 3 game that you feel embarrassed to be playing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only my experience of flashbacks within my own neurodivergent experience of the world. As they say, your mileage may vary. Your neural experience might include some different special features than my own. But if any bits of it feel familiar, please, please take some steps onto the path of trauma healing. You may feel ready to engage with a trauma therapist immediately, or you may feel called to do some work and research on your own first. There’s no wrong answer or pathway. But start walking down that path. You deserve not to get stuck in the past. You deserve to heal. And you needn’t do it yourself. Ask for help. &lt;/p&gt;

And that lived experience is something I'm still accumulating.  While I’ve read many solutions and strategies and created plenty of other solutions of my own, I still struggle sometimes with many of the same issues facing my clients. Right now, there's a project that I’ve been desperately wanting to get off the ground all year, but which I have procrastinated and avoided because a) it’s new and different and fairly overwhelming, b) additional pressure and feeling behind spells productivity doom for me, and c) it feels a bit like leveling up, which is pretty daunting. It feels like there’s a boss battle ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;cue Bowser music&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to launch a YouTube channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have successfully launched a YouTube struggle. But I am determined to post a video in the foreseeable future, so I have got to start getting out of my own way. I absolutely love working with my coaching clients, but I want to help more people develop habits and systems that work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; their neurodiversity. So video is my next frontier. A very intimidating (to me) frontier. So I’ve decided to coach myself across the finish line by blogging about my struggles and progress and essentially treating myself as one of my clients in my posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not quite unhinged enough by this project to present an actual back and forth with myself publicly on my blog. But give it time, give it time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve worked out that there are four strategies that will be instrumental in breaking me out of my project paralysis over the next few weeks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validating my feelings about this project.&lt;/strong&gt; If there’s anything that my ADHD research and coaching work has taught me, it’s that no one’s going anywhere until they have processed the feelings that caused the avoidance and procrastination. So, I’m not denying that the big leap onto YouTube isn’t scary. There’s all sorts of reasons why it is. There’s plenty of cool reasons why it’ll be great, but those have not, to date, been motivating enough to overpower the fear-inspired avoidance. So, I’m acknowledging that it’s pretty frightening. I’m sitting with that part of me that, in the moment, wants to work on anything else but this YouTube project. And once that part of me feels a little better, I’ll remind myself that I’ve done all manner of scary, impossible projects in the past, and that if I pay attention to myself and lean into the strategies I give my clients, then I’ll get there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pomodoros.&lt;/strong&gt; Pomodoros are 25-minute chunks of focused work followed by a short break and a reward. They are useful for everyone (and I’ll do a deep dive post about them some day), but they are particularly great for people with ADHD and for people with ginormous terrifying tasks. They require a relatively limited amount of focus with fixed parameters AND a reward at the end. I’m also scheduling Pomodoros with friends so that I also can use the strategy of body doubling. It really helps our amygdalas calm down and focus if we know we’re not alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting help.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the mantras that’s been drilled into me is that “I can do anything I put my mind to”. While this is generally true, it omits an important piece of the equation: just because I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do something doesn’t mean that that is the best use of my time or energy, especially if I might get bogged down in the details or lose days because I start avoiding a subtask that feels daunting. So I’m setting a goal to ask someone for help &lt;em&gt;each day&lt;/em&gt; to remind myself how crucial this strategy will be to success. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carving off tiny, doable pieces and NOT planning or timelining.&lt;/strong&gt; One of my personal paradoxes is that I love planning for other people and their projects, but often when I plan for my own projects I get overwhelmed and defeated before I start. Seeing the entirety of the plan reminds me of how far I am from achieving my goal, kicks off some guilt for not having started the project already, and just generally stalls out my efforts. So until I hit a point where a plan will do more good than harm, I’m NOT giving myself a project plan. Instead, each day I’ll figure out a small slice that seems manageable and tackle it. Today, I set up lights and recorded a test video. That kicked off a bit of research on makeup for videos and YouTube SEO. And tomorrow? We’ll see what tomorrow brings. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s it. That’s my plan for breaking the gridlock on this project. If it works, you’ll see an announcement that my first video has launched. And if it doesn’t you’ll see a post where I talk about the hurdles I ran into and how I jumped over them. (Spoiler: These will be hurdles of my own making – I am self-hurdling)&lt;/p&gt;

Its companion piece, &lt;a href="/tidying-graph-paper-methodology.html"&gt;How Executive Functioning Impacts Tidiness&lt;/a&gt;, explains the underpinnings of difficulties with tidying. Each step in The Graph Paper Method is intentional, and I encourage you to explore the context that post provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re going to draw a map of the horizontal surfaces in your home and color in small areas of progress on your map every day that will correspond to real world progress in your home. This map lets you easily see that you’re carving out progress, even if it’s hard to see in the rooms themselves. It reduces the pressure to figure out where to start: all you have to do is keep plugging away and you will progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidying in this case means putting objects away where they belong, throwing away trash, neatly arranging anything that permanently lives on the surface, folding blankets that live on the sofa, and so on. Essentially, it means returning a surface to its ideal, orderly state. It does not have to mean cleaning and dusting the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick the room or rooms in your home where you want to begin your tidying journey. Starting with a room where you spend most of your time is a great beginning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a sheet of graph paper (or plain paper if graph paper isn’t handy or printable), sketch a two-dimensional, view-from-above floor plan of the furniture and objects that live permanently in the room. Exposed horizontal surfaces only – the objects that collect clutter. Here's an example drawing of my living room, with our blue couch, purple armchair, and assorted tables, shelving units, and TV trays.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width = "400px" src="/images/blog/tidying/Living Room Map - blank.png" alt="Graph paper with outlines representing the furniture in the author's living room." align=center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide on the minimum amount of time you’ll tidy each day. Try to pick the longest amount of time that will still be easy and doable 100% of the time. Maybe this is 10 minutes. Maybe it is 2 minutes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick rewards. Reward yourself for starting your tidy habit, reward yourself while you’re doing it, and when you finish it. All the rewards. We’re changing a lifetime of habits here so pull out all the stops to keep yourself feeling good about this new habit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up reminders. Set a timer on your phone to remind you each day/evening to tidy a surface or portion of a surface. Put sticky notes in visible places you’ll encounter at relevant, helpful times (e.g. the tv remote). Recruit a support system of friends and family to help reinforce the habit. If the people you cohabitate with aren’t on board with tackling the tidying part with you, then ask if they’ll DJ while you tidy. Or buddy up with a friend and text progress photos to one another. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speak to yourself with gentle, kind intentions about this habit. Tidiness is hard, and it’s okay that you need scaffolding and support around it. You deserve all the kindness, rewards, and encouragement while you build this habit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each day, pick a surface in the room that you can completely tidy during the time range you’ve selected (e.g. 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes). Subdividing areas into multiple days is totally acceptable – heck, you can even divide up portions of the couch or definitely divide up portions of the kitchen counter. Incremental forward progress is the important part here. Include progress on the floor! Make sure the mental and physical energy you have available matches the surface you pick for the day. Be gentle and kind with what you ask of yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When your reminder chimes, tidy the bit of horizontal surface that you’ve selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color in this area on your sketch once you’ve completed it. In my example drawing of my living room, I  highlighted a portion of the couch that I tidied, removing stray laundry and pads of paper.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width = "400px" src="/images/blog/tidying/Living Room Map - Step One.png" alt="Graph paper with outlines representing the furniture in the author's living room. A section of the couch has been colored yellow." align=center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perform a maintenance tidy of all the areas you have already colored in. The only items on the maintenance areas will be items you’ve used today, which hopefully makes the items relatively easy to put away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep tidying areas in your home until all the areas on your map are colored in. Draw an additional map to cover new rooms. This final example drawing shows progress after about a week, with multiple colored-in surfaces that are now tidy.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width = "400px" src="/images/blog/tidying/Living Room Map - One Week In.png" alt="Graph paper with outlines representing the furniture in the author's living room. Several disjointed areas have been colored yellow." align=center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep rewarding yourself for maintaining your routine. Switch up the rewards if your motivation begins to wane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your tidiness slips, there could be two issues at play. You might need to mix up your rewards so that keeping the tidiness is more appealing. Or it might be a sign that other parts of your life are overwhelming or a bit too hectic. Consider that the tidiness is a sign of struggle and not any sort of personal failure. It’s OKAY if your house gets messy again because now you’ve got an easy way out before it reaches critical mass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s it for the graph paper method. There’s a fair bit of purpose and structure behind the method, and I invite you to explore that in &lt;a href="/tidying-graph-paper-methodology.html"&gt;How Executive Functioning Impacts Tidiness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This article has a companion post, &lt;a href="/tidying-graph-paper-method-only.html"&gt;Building a Tidying Habit: The Graph Paper Method&lt;/a&gt;, which describes a method you can start today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width = "400px"  src="/images/blog/tidying/my-housekeeping-style-is-best-described-as-there-appears-to-have-been-a-struggle-meme-1437870283.jpg" alt="black and white picture of a woman sitting in a wingback chair with her right arm on the chair and her forehead resting on her hand. Around her there is a chaotic room with upended chairs, artwork on the floor, etc. There is a caption that reads 'My housekeeping style is best described as there appears to have been a struggle'"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it often appears that there’s been a struggle in my home. My whole life I have struggled to keep my spaces neat and organized. Whether I was busy, burnt out, depressed, or just, you know, eight, I have struggled with the motivation, focus, and planning required to keep things tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to my ADHD diagnosis, I thought my messiness was just a deep-seated character flaw. But with diagnosis came clarity, self-compassion, and the understanding that the clutter and untidiness are an outward manifestation of my executive functioning struggles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think back to how I struggled as a girl with undiagnosed ADHD, I have so much compassion for that little kid. I can see how all of it fits into my neurodivergent brain. Rarely would I play with just one set of toys in a play session, but I would pull out a lot of different activities in one afternoon, navigating between the activities when I got bored. The advice to “put my toys away when I was done” didn’t compute because I was never done. That activity was just on hold while something else sparked my imagination. By the end of a play session, it looked like a chaos monster had entered the room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: the chaos monster lived in the room. It is me. I am the chaos monster who whirls through the room, leaving destruction and unfinished projects in her wake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the chaos of my play habits, tidying took executive functioning skills that I just didn’t have, doubly so if I was trying to clean because I was in trouble. Motivation is a perpetual struggle for people with executive dysfunction, and what kid is especially motivated for the chore of tidying? And lastly, tidying my room was a minefield of distractions. How could I put away the book on the floor when that book screamed, “Read me!”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, because of my autism and love for sorting and order, if you took me to a hardware store, I would tidy the endcaps. I'm sure it was maddening to observe this dichotomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that the Graph Paper method I propose has succeeded for me, an ADHD, autistic adult who is not naturally equipped with the skills to keep a tidy home. This method is battle tested. Has it worked forever? No. But I’m increasingly embracing that my battle with order and chaos will be life-long – I have begun to accept, without judgment, that I have neat phases and messy phases, which are a pretty good barometer of my overall mental health, not a reflection of my character. The messy phases are a sign that I need more self-care and more support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Graph Paper Method's goal is NOT to tidy your house as quickly as possible (that’s why we invite guests over, after all) but to build a relatively sustainable, neurodivergent-friendly habit. You can read &lt;a href="/tidying-graph-paper-method-only.html"&gt;the method itself&lt;/a&gt; now or later if you like. The rest of this post gives background on habit formation, the neurodivergent brain, and how to proceed applying this method while healing any internal damage you've sustained by living a cluttered life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Habit Building&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating habits can be difficult regardless of whether you are neurodivergent or neurotypical. New habits require change, and all our brains like what’s easy and already familiar (i.e. our old behavior). So it takes planning, intention, and repetition to establish a new way of doing things. In other words, it takes some work and a little understanding of how to program new habits into our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every habit needs three components: a cue, an action, and a reward. The cue is what reminds us to do the action, and the reward is what lights up our dopamine receptors so that we want to keep repeating the habit, day after day after day&lt;sup id="fnref:duhigg"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:duhigg"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cues need to be reliable occurrences, guaranteed to pop up so that the habit doesn’t rely on us remembering to do it. Established routines are great cues, or you could use alarms on your phone. But you will need a reminder. Possibly several. Post notes where you will see them frequently so that this new habit is well advertised. Set calendar reminders so this new habit is top of mind. Whatever it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our action is this new habit of tidying. Since tidying can be hard for the neurodivergent and making habits stick can be hard for everyone, we’ll lower the barriers to tidying so that it’s easy to be successful, every single day. That means that we’ll start very small, with a time commitment that feels comfortable and achievable every single day, even on our busiest, tiredest of days. Consistency is how we make this habit stick. Our method will use some scaffolding to support our executive functioning when it comes to this tidiness habit so we can make tracking and seeing our progress much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, lastly, there’s the rewards. Our hungry little brains LOVE rewards. We love the dump of brain chemicals that get delivered with rewards, and we love the idea that we’ve earned a prize.  The prize is what keeps us coming back for more. For some habits, we might not need any external, additional reward. But if you’re reading this, it’s probably because tidying has been a challenge, and so we’ll need to make that reward extra sparkley. We are conditioning ourselves to love whatever new habit it is we’re adopting, and for tidying, that is going to take A LOT of bribery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For neurotypical people, a reward at the end of the task might be sufficient to make a new habit stick. But people with ADHD can struggle with task initiation and autistic people can struggle with transitioning from one task to another. So rewarding ourselves for starting is a critical additional component. This also safeguards us from the familiar problems many of us have with delayed rewards: either talking ourselves out of even wanting the reward if it means that we have to do the task or decided that, heck, we make the rules and can reward ourselves without doing the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Executive Functioning: Why Tidying is Hard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive functioning refers to a group of skills handled by the pre-frontal cortex portion of our brains. Many, many neurodivergent people struggle with the skills as well as kids who haven't developmentally grown into these skills yet. The table below lists executive functioning skills&lt;sup id="fnref:ef_course"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ef_course"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and how struggles with those skills might manifest when one is trying to tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;

  border: 1px solid black;
  border-collapse: collapse;
  padding: 5px
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Struggles to realistically estimate how long it will take and start with enough time to finish.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Working memory&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;What was I working on before I picked up this shiny thing?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Self-Monitoring and metacognition&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Accidentally spends a lot of time on minute, detailed work (e.g. organization of bookshelf) instead of overall tidying.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Inhibition and impulse control&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Look at this cool thing I unearthed! &lt;em&gt;falls into rabbit hole&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Emotional control&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Difficulty managing frustration and shame.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sustained attention&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Struggles to keep tidying when it is boring.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Task Initiation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Very hard to start tidying. So hard.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Flexibility&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Struggles to accept partner’s methods for tidying.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Goal-Directed persistence&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Makes progress on tidying in short-term but struggles to maintain efforts in long-term.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Stress tolerance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Melts down during cleaning because it seems hopeless&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm just going to pause for a moment while you absorb the emotional impact of that heap of struggles. I sourced the list of executive functioning skills from a course I took, but the examples are high-quality, artisanal struggles from a lifetime of living with a neurodivergent brain. It is impossible for me to review that table without a flood of memories and echoes of criticism (that'd be the cPTSD talking). As you read that list, you may feel grief for agony endured or a flare of rage at having been expected to do the impossible without instruction, support, or scaffolding. And if that's the first time you've seen a list of executive functioning skills and are seeing your past through a whole new set of hindsight goggles, give yourself a moment. It's a lot to take in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. Back to the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are SO many moving parts involved with tidying and so many points where our executive function struggles trip us up. As with all spectrums that we encounter in neurodivergence, you may struggle with some of these skills and excel at others. You may find that even some strengths have vanished completely when you’re stressed, tired, preoccupied, or under emotional duress. And, hoo boy, it can be very distressing to have your strengths vanish if you don’t understand the role your amygdala plays in this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our amygdala is one of the oldest parts of our brain, dedicated to guaranteeing survival and sensing fear. It is the center of our infamous fight or flight response (or more completely, flight/fight/freeze/fawn response). When we experience strong emotions and our amygdalas take over, our prefrontal cortex gets inhibited. As I remind my clients, if we are running away from a Grizzly bear, our brain knows we need to be focused on the bear, not developing and executing a project plan, so our amygdala takes over. It’s a feature, not a bug. Humans who did not outrun the bear did not procreate, so our evolutionary history has favored this little almond-sized nugget of instinct. Of course, we rarely have interactions with Grizzly bears in our modern lives. But our amygdala can’t tell the difference between fear from a Grizzly bear and the fear that we’ve lost our keys (again. today.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the task of tidying and cleaning through the lens of skills that make up executive functioning, it becomes clear that setting expectations for us to clean or tidy without significant support is a recipe of failure and crushing defeat. We need alternate systems and processes for tidying compared to neurotypicals. The same is true for those of us whose parents were absent and unable or unwilling to teach them how to be tidy in developmentally appropriate ways when we were young. Generally, and especially if we were late diagnosed, we may not have received adequate support and instruction as children. Specifically we may not have been taught how to tidy in ways that supported our neurodivergence or tidying may not have been taught at all. We may have been punished for not being able to perform this task which was far more complex and difficult for us than the adults in our lives realized. Tidying requires every single one of those executive functioning skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: If you are a partner, parent, or friend of someone with executive dysfunction, please recognize that even encouragement often sounds like pressure and expectations. And pressure and expectations will often backfire because they activate our amygdalas. We are not messy because we are lazy, inherently disorganized, vengeful, or stubborn. Being neat is a difficult skill for us. Hopefully this article has conveyed to you the complexity of the problem we face in trying to bring order to this external chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there IS hope. Scaffolding and support can help us learn and adopt strategies that feel good and are (relatively) enjoyable to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On trauma and shame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many, many neurodiverse people have experienced trauma related to their weirdness, including both their unusual strengths and skills and their atypical weaknesses. When I talk to people who struggle with tidiness, I hear echoes of judgments, bullying, and criticisms that they’ve accumulated over the years – echoes they repeat to themselves, perpetuating and compounding the initial shame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame feels terrible and gross. It’s a punishment, and punishments create avoidant behavior.
Why does shame lead to avoidant behavior? It activates our amygdala, first of all. Are we going to be punished for what we haven't done? Are we already being punished? Then run away. It's a classic flight response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worse you personally feel about the untidiness in your home, the more likely you are to stay paralyzed about how to tackle it. So in addition to providing lots of positive reinforcement, we need to actively resolve the shame. We need to provide our internal selves with supportive, positive reinforcement. We need to heal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to our external messiness, most of us have some pretty hefty internalized shame and self-criticism. It is a cesspool in there (in the shame pit, not in your living room). But we have the opportunity to disrupt that here. Every day when you perform this tidiness habit, it’s a chance to intentionally change your internal dialog. Your inner dialog might try to “help” by turning a critical eye towards what you haven’t done yet. Encourage your inner dialog to get curious about this new way that you’re learning. This way has support and structure that was missing in the old way that you tidied. YOU aren’t a failure. The old tidying system was, but that system is not you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Overwhelm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, my ability to get overwhelmed is on a hair trigger. I struggle to figure out where to start, and in assessing where I COULD start, I really notice how messy things are, which kicks off the shame spiral. I feel defeated before I even start. This whole process HURTS. It is self-punishment, and it’s critical to break this cycle that, of course, gets in the way of tidying, but more importantly, is a miserable way to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to feeling miserable, once we’re overwhelmed, our access to our executive functioning withers. The Graph Paper Method takes care of some of the executive functioning for you by keeping track of what you’ve done already – even if it got untidy again as you went about your day. Each day you don’t need to pick where to START; you only need to pick one very small area to actually tidy. Since we’re chipping away day after day, it really doesn’t matter what you pick. You’ll hit all the areas eventually. So just pick what is easiest, either by the volume of objects on the surface or the ease of putting those objects away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a surface is cluttered enough to kick off overwhelm, then divide that surface into portions that are not overwhelming. Tidy half of it – or a quarter. This method is very much focused on long-term success, so each day you make the task as easy as possible so that you keep doing it each and every day. Yes, your home will get tidied much more gradually than if you rallied to try to clean everything all at once. But by rewarding yourself for small amounts of work each and every day and maintaining that tidiness, you can minimize the chance of clutter relapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this method helps prevent overwhelm because the two-dimensional diagram a) visually simplifies the problem of tracking what you might work on b) keeps a record of your progress, eliminating the need for you to remember what surfaces you’re committed to maintaining and c) clearly indicates progress – something your jerk of a brain may forget because it wants to focus on what you haven’t tidied yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADHD and Habit Building and Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot overstate how important it is to build satisfying rewards into the process for those of us with ADHD. We struggle with task initiation and motivation. Boring tasks are our arch nemesis. This method uses tiny, easily tackled, incremental change because we DO NOT WANT TO TIDY unless it is enjoyable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reward business is NOT about feeling as if you need to earn nice things to enjoy them. There’s no value judgment here. It is purely about habit formation. Rewards help make new habits sticky. For an easier habit, the glowing satisfaction of achieving the habit might be satisfying. But for tidying, we’ve got to pull out the big guns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the role the rewards play in habit formation, we’re working to convince our brain that tidying isn’t the horrible, miserable punishment of our past. Good things happen in the long term when we tidy – fewer lost items, less tripping and slipping on our stuff, and a calm, organized space. But we’ve got to sell our brains on the idea in the short term so we can get to the long term. The reward is a campaign to show our reluctant little brains that this tidying lark is okay – and there’s no looming punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people will want rewards that are consistent, repeatable, and dependable. Embrace the ritual and routine. Soak up the joy of your reward, but consider switching your reward if the shine ever begins wearing off. If you respond best to consistency and ritual, then consider two or three rewards that you change weekly, monthly, or as-needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people will benefit from rewards that are surprises with a tiny bit of mystery and suspense. Intermittent rewards will actually make the habit even stickier (think slot machines). Consider rolling a die after you tidy for an additional treat and rewarding yourself a prize based on your die roll: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A piece of candy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A song from your playlist of favorites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send a supportive, validating friend a snapshot of your progress graph or a selfie of you and your tidy area &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sing yourself a ridiculous made-up song about the thing you just cleaned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put away one more thing. Roll again when you’re done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing. No reward. Tidy again tomorrow for another chance!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I tell my clients, ultimately, it isn't that our neurodivergent brains are broken or imperfect. We're no more flawed than any other person walking the planet. But we may not have learned or adapted systems that fit our glorious brains. What works for us will be different. While it might seem that it's taking significant effort to rewire your systems to better accommodate you, it is worth it. And going forward, if you have neurodivergent children in your life, you can help them learn strategies early that will suit them their whole lives. &lt;/p&gt;

These kinds of lists are serviceable at best and at worst can be defeatist, paralyzing, and a recipe for failure. They fail spectacularly when you struggle with decision fatigue, prioritization, or when you feel torn between tasks you really want to do and tasks you hate but feel like you OUGHT to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I so passionate about to-do lists? The short answer is that I spent 40+ years with undiagnosed ADHD, struggling to figure out how to get myself organized and focused. Sometimes this was pretty easy. I'm an optimizer. Give me a pile of time and physical constraints, and I'll be massively productive. But if you gave me an 8-hour uninterrupted block of time, it often meant I would make a list; get overwhelmed, demotivated, and defeated; and then waste the entire day. It wasn't until I was diagnosed with ADHD that I began to understand why I get stuck in this cycle. It’s not a mark of failure, immaturity, or laziness. I just need some scaffolding to help ease the executive functioning load on my brain so I can succeed with less frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/blog/to-do list/List everything.jpg" alt="oldschool to-do list with checked off entries called list everything, do one thing, look at list, get overwhelmed, doomscroll" style="margin:10px;" align=left&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ADHD diagnosis also gave me insight into how emotional dysregulation can be at the root of struggling to get things started and finished. We need help managing our boredom, dread, disgust, sadness, and discomfort. And it’s not just people with ADHD who need this support. Anxiety, depression, grief, burnout, huge life changes, and the ongoing struggle of coping in a global pandemic can all impact our ability to process our emotions which, in turn, impacts our motivation and ability to focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own struggle, I initially felt that there must be One True Answer. One perfect format that suited me. I found plenty, but they never worked for very long. But of course, they weren’t The Answer for several reasons, primarily because my mental needs fluctuate, so I’m simply not going to settle into a rhythm that always works. Life, circumstances, and internal and external stressors change, so it absolutely makes sense that a one-size fits all solution just isn’t realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series is about finding the right structure for your day’s energy, focus, and level of executive functioning as they fluctuate based on your stress level, sleep quality, anxiety, outside disturbances, and much more. I’ll present not just how each format works, but also WHY it works. At the end of the series, I’ll conclude with a handy guide so that you can easily match your struggle with the right kinds of scaffolding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll kick things off next post with a quick overview of why your motivation gets hijacked and some other foundational issues you may have encountered in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s still cooking; no risk of whatever the newsletter equivalent of food poisoning from serving half-baked ideas. Nope. I don't want to spoil the day after the weirdest Labor Day ever. (Happy Labor Day, btw).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, let's get a head start on the Halloween season by talking about the potential horrors of remote work. Lately, I’ve seen a lot of articles about the dangers and pitfalls of working from home and being socially isolated. What's missing from those articles is usually the specifics and nearly always some solutions. I’ll tackle this issue in the next couple of newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s look at some examples of how this social isolation might play with your perceptions in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re evolved to be social creatures. We are considerably less social when working remotely, unless our companies have a great remote work culture. If we’re cut off from people physically, our brains can start to freak out a little bit. While we logically understand what’s going on, our little caveman brains that depend upon social structures can start to create all sorts of destructive stories about what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s just one example of what can happen when we’re separated from our co-workers: Everyone else’s struggle is invisible. When you don't see your co-workers throughout the day, you miss hearing them grumble about how their project isn't going well or that client who’s hard to manage. Simply put, you’ve lost some channels of information that tell you you’re not alone in whatever you’re struggling with. Your problems can feel unsolvable and uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some other examples that stem from having incomplete information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone else’s work looks effortless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No else has a learning curve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone else is slacking off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, I’m slacking off and everyone else is working really hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person X isn’t doing any work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably get the idea at this point. Our brains can be really bad judges of what’s going on, especially if they feel like we’ve been cut off from the herd. We are the lone antelope surrounded by imaginary lions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s talk about some solutions! It’s not all doom and gloom, I promise. There’s a way out of the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, one of the big problems we have is that we have less information to disprove our confirmation biases when we’re isolated. Confirmation bias is our human tendency to give heavier weight to evidence which confirms our existing theories and disregard or downplay evidence which might disprove it. This is a helpful shortcut usually -- it saves us having to re-prove gravity every single day. Confirmation bias helps us make sense of the world -- it serves an evolutionary purpose. But what happens when the idea that gets stuck in your head is one that causes you a huge amount of anxiety such as, “I’m going to lose my job if things don’t change.” That sort of thought is almost as unshakeable as it is miserable; your brain will do all sorts of mental gymnastics to disregard evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s the short term way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1. Give your amygdala a big old dose of validation for whatever it is that’s bothering you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I talked about amygdala days, where your brain’s emotional centers take control and cut off or seriously impede your brain’s access to the higher order thinking skills in your pre-frontal cortex. Skills that, well, many of us get paid to access these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our amygdalas HATE it when we aren’t truly listening to them. And sometimes that just makes them dig their heels in further (or more insidiously, e.g. mega insomnia). The key to unclench your amygdala's hold is to validate what it's feeling, even if other parts of your brain are screaming that your amygdala is dumb and illogical. Tell those judgey parts of your brain to hush up for a minute (or we will NEVER get the amygdala to calm down).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://michaelssorensen.com/validation-the-most-powerful-relationship-skill-you-were-never-taught/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Validate-Someone%27s-Feelings"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; about validation really resonated with me a couple of weeks ago, and they can explain much better than I can how to validate someone else. So read them if you have a chance… and then use them on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will go something like this. “Oh, amygdala. It’s terrifying to think about losing your job. No wonder you’re so worried and anxious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And your amygdala will say, “OMG. Thank you. Yes, I am so exhausted from being worried. I’m going to go take a nap and rest, okay?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, it may not play out exactly like that, but seriously, there is enormous relief in just validating what your amygdala has been jumping up and down about at 3 AM trying to warn you about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, so while your amygdala is napping and catching its breath, you can proceed to step two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2. Figure out the logical fallacies that were at play.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what was going on with that confirmation bias? How did your brain develop its weirdo, fringe conspiracy theory based on two facts with no context and the remote work rumor mill? Behold, &lt;a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/"&gt;this list of cognitive distortions&lt;/a&gt; holds the keys to what went awry. Now that our amygdala is snoozing, examining the list of cognitive distortions can help us see the world differently and perhaps even see that alternate views of our situation might even be more believable or potentially likely enough to ward off 3 AM existential crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for the short-term steps. We’ll talk again about some long term steps to help guard against the pitfalls of remote work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>When Your Prefrontal Cortex is Closed For Business Due to the Pandemic</title><link href="https://www.datasmithing.com/prefrontal-cortex.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-10T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-08-10T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Melissa Smith</name></author><id>tag:www.datasmithing.com,2020-08-10:/prefrontal-cortex.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bear with me while I set a bit of context for today’s topic.

That’s the set of skills you use to make decisions, prioritize, and plan your morning, your day, and your life. Maybe you have some days where you are absolutely on fire, knocking important things off your to-do list, left and right. And maybe you’ve got other days where you can barely make out your to-do list, much less make progress on it. Hold onto that thought while I veer off for a little more context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m working with a startup that’s developing emotional intelligence apps for kids (and adults, as applicable) with disabilities, particularly kids on the autism spectrum. One member of our group is &lt;a href="https://www.dr-christie.com/"&gt;Dr. Christie Sosnowski-Bowen&lt;/a&gt;, a fantastic child psychologist who has specialized in kids on the spectrum but sees all sorts of kids in her private practice. A side benefit of having a psychologist in our group is that we’re all able to speak a little more openly about our own struggles, especially throughout COVID. A couple of weeks ago, I was describing some issues I was having with my executive functioning, and Dr. Christie dropped some knowledge that completely changed my perspective. She can explain in much better than I can, but I'll give it an oversimplified whirl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That executive functioning ability? That’s controlled by the prefrontal cortex portion of your brain, nestled right up next to your forehead. You’ve also got a part of your brain called the amygdala which handles emotions and motivation. The amygdala is, uh, responsive. Very responsive. And bossy. It takes over when the stakes are high, cutting your prefrontal cortex out of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you’re having a crap day where every decision seems to take a monumental amount of effort, your amygdala has taken control of your brain’s steering wheel. Pandemic-related grief, anxiety, and fear or just being on the receiving end of an internet troll, all of these things can send your amygdala running to the rescue and taking over control. And let’s just say the pandemic and American politics have got all our amygdalas running back-to-back marathons. So how are you supposed to tackle work while your amygdala is fired up… again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three strategies to get you through your Amygdala Days. There’s plenty more we could talk about, but if you’re having an Amygdala Day, then more than three strategies are going to short-circuit you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outsource your Executive Function.&lt;/strong&gt; Buddy up with a coworker (or your spouse, in a pinch) and ask them to point you towards a single item on your to do list. When you’ve finished that one, ask for another, and so on. Repay the favor when they have an Amygdala Day. You and your buddy should also help break massive tasks (i.e. prepare the quarterly report) down to some manageable substeps. This may sound hokey, but my spouse directed me to do things on my list on Saturday, and it was one of the best days I’ve had in ages. Ah, the glorious freedom to not have to decide what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roll the dice.&lt;/strong&gt; This is an especially good strategy for weekend days, but it may also help on work days. Make yourself a numbered to-do list and then roll dice (or &lt;a href="https://www.wizards.com/dnd/dice/dice.htm"&gt;use a virtual dice roller&lt;/a&gt;) to pick which item to work on. The underlying assumption here is that the order in which you do things doesn’t really matter… it just matters that you get started so that you’re not paralyzed by indecision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrow your focus to three tiny things.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve covered this strategy before in the newsletter about working when you’re anxious and distracted. This is a great strategy when you know WHAT you should be working on, but you can’t get your mind to settle enough to start focusing. So break off three tiny things that would move your project forward. They can be as easy as ‘Bold list headings’. They just need to be easy enough that you can tackle them. It’s sort of like creating a breadcrumb trail in front of you to get yourself out of the forest. Just stay focused on the breadcrumbs. When you’ve done two or three, add more. Keep your list short so you never get overwhelmed, and you’ll be out of the forest in no time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>When Remote Work is a Literal Pain in the Neck or Back</title><link href="https://www.datasmithing.com/remote-pain.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-13T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-07-13T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Melissa Smith</name></author><id>tag:www.datasmithing.com,2020-07-13:/remote-pain.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is easy to accidentally spend the entire day curled over your laptop, typing away at your latest documentation manifesto.

Or to have a million stressful chats, emails, and phone calls which leave your shoulders up by your ears. Your body will yell at you when you do these things. Here’s some tips on keeping the back, shoulder, and neck pain at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve your office ergonomics.&lt;/strong&gt; Are you craning your neck to look at your monitor? Take some time to reconfigure your desk so that your computer and keyboard are at the proper levels for your body. Check out these &lt;a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/work-from-home-ergonomics-101/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.bu.edu/articles/2020/10-ergonomics-dos-and-donts-for-those-now-working-from-home/"&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; if you need help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take stretch breaks.&lt;/strong&gt; The joy of working from home is that no one can see you when you get up from your desk and roll around on the floor between conference calls. So go ahead and downward dog as a reward for slogging through your email inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a foam roller.&lt;/strong&gt; If your upper back is tense, that can impact both our lower back and your neck. To tide you over until you feel comfortable getting a massage, get a foam roller and massage your upper back as shown in this video from the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD71TBqbGEU"&gt;Mayo Clinic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify what makes you tense so you can take evasive action.&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe it’s when your boss chats you. Or maybe it’s after you present at the weekly meeting. Pay attention to when your body yells at you. Then schedule some reminders to stretch and take breaks BEFORE you start hurting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a lunch break, preferably a walk.&lt;/strong&gt; Just stepping away from your computer will help your neck and eyes. But taking a walk… maybe you wear a step counter and have noticed that working remotely makes it really easy to beat your lowest score. All that inactivity can begin to take its toll on your body, including your back. The more you can get moving during the day, the less your back will yell at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider some ab exercises.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re like me and your workout routine turned nearly non-existent at some unidentified point during the pandemic, then it could be that your back’s hurting because it doesn’t have the support of your six pack, four pack, or two pack anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Separation of Work and Personal: Don’t Cross the Beams</title><link href="https://www.datasmithing.com/separate-work.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-20T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-05-20T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Melissa Smith</name></author><id>tag:www.datasmithing.com,2020-05-20:/separate-work.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today’s message is pretty simple: don’t use your work computer for personal business when you work from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem obvious, but I think it's important enough that it’s worth reminding ourselves of it on a regular basis. When we’re at home the lines get blurred. While you were at the office, you probably did the occasional bit of surfing here and there. Depending upon how your company runs its IT department, you might be monitored a bit more closely. Maybe they’re not watching at all, but these are still good work computer hygiene habits to establish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block social media sites in your browser.&lt;/strong&gt; Consider blacklisting Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media sites that you’re tempted to browse when you get a little bored during work. I’m not saying you have to stay off the fun parts of the internet during work hours. Just don’t do it on your work computer. I’m calling out social media sites in particular because they contain such personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear out your stored passwords.&lt;/strong&gt; If you aren’t already using a password vault like LastPass, I recommend it as a great way to generate and store unique passwords, all locked behind a single master password for your account. At the very least, removing the stored passwords from your browser will put a tiny barrier between you and a site that you haven’t unblocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t sign into your browser.&lt;/strong&gt; Signing into your browser lets you access your bookmarks and saved passwords across your computers. Unless you love the idea of accidentally pulling up NSFW images during your next presentation, sign out now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use your smartphone instead.&lt;/strong&gt; Not only will this keep your browsing history private, but you can also establish the habit of taking a break from your desk while you’re using your phone. Do a couple laps around your house or yard. Stretch your legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lastly, speaking of your smartphone, remove your work email from it.&lt;/strong&gt; Retake your life off the clock. While we’re all figuring out new boundaries between work and home, do yourself the favor of cutting this cord so that when you’re off work, you’re really off work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Calling in Sick</title><link href="https://www.datasmithing.com/sick-day.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-06T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-05-06T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Melissa Smith</name></author><id>tag:www.datasmithing.com,2020-05-06:/sick-day.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to figure out when to call in sick when you work from home.

You don’t have to worry about getting your co-workers sick, so you might be inclined to call in sick only under the most extreme circumstances, right? That, my friends, is one of the many reasons why work-life balance can be harder when you work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this kind of decision is easy for you, but it wasn’t for me when I first began working from home. I always erred on the side of powering through at my own expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some food for thought before we get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one gives Perfect Attendance awards anymore. (If they do, their priorities are out of whack).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not owe it to your job to give them all of the time that you don’t feel like crap while you’re sick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking a sick day may improve your reputation as a remote worker; it means that you take your commitment to doing quality work seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider taking the advice you would give a good friend or subordinate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are feeling sub-par, your work may also be sub-par. That does no one favors and could damage your reputation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not feeling great myself, so you can judge for yourself whether I ought to have called in sick today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Push Through If You Only Feel “Under the Weather” and…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve got a significant deadline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don’t have PTO or sick days to spare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have some easy tasks where you can phone it in for a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have some checks and balances in your process that can catch any mistakes that slip through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consider Working Odd Hours to Catch Up If...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any of the above apply and...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is not a hardship to rearrange your schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The illness you have is predictable (i.e. allergies or the bug your family just had) and you’ll be able to tell when to push and when to nap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catching up later will not make you stressed out and sicker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Go Either Way If...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve got a low-grade fever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concentrating on work is difficult but not impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meds will alleviate many of your symptoms with tolerable side effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definitely Call in Sick If...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve got more than a one-degree fever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No quantity of naps or medicine will help you feel better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is VERY difficult to concentrate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This work week is easy, but next week isn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a Thursday or Friday. (You do not have to sacrifice your weekend by pushing through the week).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Always Call in Sick If…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have more than a two-degree fever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have significant “gastrointestinal distress” with output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have pain that makes it impossible to concentrate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You make an Emergency Room visit. Even if it’s a relatively quick visit, you’re assuredly very stressed and probably need some aftercare. No one will fault you once you say, “I need to go to the ER”, and they shouldn’t need to know more details than that.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;While Everyone is Still Remote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start remote office traditions.&lt;/strong&gt; For many offices, there’s a feeling of togetherness and camaraderie that keeps the team together and functioning through the hard times. Starting some remote office traditions will help alleviate some of the stress of these uncertain times, but they will also reinforce that feeling that the team is in this together. Ideas include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silly hat Friday for all meetings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom background contests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom lunches where everyone has takeout to simulate weekday lunches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate together.&lt;/strong&gt; Find a way to honor people’s birthdays and other events in ways that aren’t generic. Send meaningful YouTube links. Collect favorite stories about your co-worker. Arrange a ridiculous surprise with the co-workers partner, roommate, or neighbor’s co-operation. If you’re all still relatively local, arrange for a social distanced marching band to wish them happy birthday from their front lawn during a meeting. Something big. Get creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider the occasional, optional virtual Happy Hour.&lt;/strong&gt; As onerous as these may be to the introverts among us, group social time is crucial. Consider a flexible format to these, with smaller groups. Perhaps just invite a couple of people you like but haven’t talked to in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start lunch-and-learns.&lt;/strong&gt; Learning together helps build teams, and giving people a chance to lead a lunch-and-learn is a great way to let people shine. During the remainder of the pandemic, these lunch-and-learns can be invaluable ways to help your co-workers get through that list of problems you’ve identified in your research. They’re also a helpful way to socialize while avoiding the dreaded small talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider a company video series or channel.&lt;/strong&gt; Remote work can be depersonalizing. People become talking heads, and it’s especially easy for people who don’t attend meetings together to forget the people behind the emails. Videos are an AWESOME way to help your co-workers resolve the issues you’ve uncovered, especially if they are technical. Yes, you could point your co-workers to an anonymous YouTube video that perfectly explains what they need to do. But you and your co-workers explanations will sink in better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post-Pandemic If You Stay Remote While Others Don’t&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be prepared to speak up again and again for inclusion.&lt;/strong&gt; Recruit your fellow remote workers so you can take a turn raising your hand. The people in the physical office will forget to include you. Often. That old cliche about “out of sight, out of mind” is true. It’s not out of spite, just human nature. But you’ll need to be prepared to remind them that you exist and need to be included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish an informal buddy system.&lt;/strong&gt; You and your remote companions should set reminders to regularly check-in with a buddy in the office. They will be your lifeline to what’s going on. They’ll connect you to the office gossip, and they’ll advocate for remote workers because of your connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start a #remote slack channel.&lt;/strong&gt; As you now know, working from home brings its own challenges and rewards. Band together. If you’ve stayed remote while others haven’t, it’s entirely possible that the people who went back to the office weren’t successful AT ALL at home. Get used to their jokes about pajamas and day drinking.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>10 tips for handling technical issues when you work from home</title><link href="https://www.datasmithing.com/tech-issues.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-23T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-03-23T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Melissa Smith</name></author><id>tag:www.datasmithing.com,2020-03-23:/tech-issues.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Several people requested a post focused on technical support.

There were lots of different questions covering many different platforms and needs. The specifics and details of peoples’ conundrums were far more specific than I could handle. But I consider it my job to look for patterns and universals, and find them I did. So I’m hoping that the strategies I share below are useful regardless of your particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Budget extra time for technical hiccups and practice runs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you’re adjusting to performing your usual duties while working remotely, things will take longer. Remember that the rest of your team is probably struggling with this too (or facing different struggles involving tweens and/or Playstations). Remind yourself and everyone that this adjustment takes time. Everyone will be slower while they climb this learning curve. For new stuff, no one expects you to be an expert. If they do, they’re a jerk and unreasonable (or they are up to their eyeballs in stress and distractions -- see tweens and/or Playstations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When you ask for help or stumble, say please and thank you, not sorry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may recall &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/06/01/stop-apologizing-10-alternative-approaches-to-im-sorry/#41db95ef550d"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; that circulated a few years ago about how some people apologize far too much. You are not inconveniencing people by asking for help. You’re trying to spend your time as efficiently as possible for your organization. When you work on teams, you are expected to help one another which, by definition, involves asking for help. Practice saying things like, “Thanks for your patience. Working from home is great except for the added tech support snafus, eh?” This feels better to BOTH parties compared to “Sorry for bothering you with this. I’ll let you get back to what you were working on before I interrupted you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ask for help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working remotely can make it feel like you’re alone waging a war against your to do list and your computer. But you’re not alone. If you’re stuck and can’t get yourself unstuck (or if it seems like it’s taking longer than it ought), reach out to your team. Helping feels good, and so long as you’re not constantly asking, they may appreciate the opportunity to help. And if you’re usually the person other people ask for help, you can start calling in favors in return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often people can help by asking YOU questions that trigger you to think about the issue differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you ask for help, if it’s via email or Slack, remember to provide context and specific information for what you’re doing. This makes it easier for people to help you. Screenshots are awesome, and I like the free software Jing for this purpose. You can use it to record videos too. Alternatively, you can ask someone to hop onto a quick meeting with you so that you can screen share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your team is using Slack, consider creating a channel specifically for technical help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, your IT department DOES still exist. They might be overwhelmed, but you won’t know until you ask. It could be you’ve encountered a common problem, and IT may already have developed a recommended solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Share what you’ve learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you figure out something that you think most people in your group will stumble across, be sure to share with interested people using whichever medium is most appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Divide and conquer if everyone in the group is learning new tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If many people in your group are facing multiple technical hurdles, consider whether it will make sense to divide and conquer. For example, let’s say your team is suddenly using Slack, Zoom, Google Docs, and Google Sheets to collaborate. For some, that might be an overwhelming number of new tools to learn at once. So suggest that each of your team members pick one of the four tools to really study: Read through the getting started guide, watch YouTube tutorials, and then be the expert for the team. This can help everyone in your department feel a little less overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google: not just for checking your symptoms at 1 AM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can ask Google very specific questions and usually hit the jackpot right away. For example, “how to scan using hp deskjet 2652” will return exactly what you need. Don’t forget to check the videos if you understand things better with a walkthrough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Make sure you’re not defining the problem too narrowly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be another method at your disposal that would make problem solving easier if you slightly changed how you’re defining the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your perceived need is for a coworker to scan a document and send it to you. They’ve got a printer/scanner, but they rarely use it and they are running low on patience today. Would a photo be an acceptable substitute?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your co-worker takes that photo, but you need a PDF, and your home computer doesn’t have the fancy copy of Adobe that you need. You think, ‘aha, let me search for how to convert this JPG to PDF.’ If you google ‘Convert JPG to PDF’, you get nothing but results for possibly disreputable software. But if you can mentally zoom out and google ‘easy ways to convert a file to PDF’, you’ll find articles about using ‘Print to PDF’ in MS-Office (as well as some Mac-based solutions). Chrome also lets you print to PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or let’s say you’re writing a newsletter (hi!) and your Monday and Friday posts are super long (guilty!). In fact, they are so long that Gmail truncates part of your email. And that means you no longer get nifty statistics from your newsletter platform and one morning you wake up thinking that only two (TWO!) people read your email. You could write shorter emails (but leave out presumably valuable content), edit the email content so that it contains all the info with fewer words (and probably sounds as interesting as an encyclopedia entry), or switch newsletter platforms to one that was smart enough to design around this issue (sounds time consuming). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of those solutions above? They solve the question: How can I make my emails shorter so that my platform gives me the feedback I crave and adore? But if I change the question to ‘how can I get the statistics I need and still give my readers the same content?’, then the answer becomes clear: send an overview newsletter and post the extended version on my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re stuck and can’t think of a way to broaden the problem, take a break and come back to it. Take a walk. Work on something else. Or ask a coworker to be your sounding board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If you run into a roadblock, verify that it really needs solving… by you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run into a significant roadblock, always reach out to confirm with whomever is requesting the work. Consider the following circumstances you might uncover: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since they first contacted you, the deadline changed or the project was cancelled entirely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The request was a ‘nice-to-have’ not a ‘have-to-have’ piece of the project, and it’s completely acceptable to not include that piece&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The requestor can very easily send the information in a different format that is 1000% more manageable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The initial request was a curiosity, not a need. Since it’s trouble, you can drop it entirely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these things are worth finding out before you invest your company’s time or (more importantly) your energy on solving the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If you’re hosting a webinar or livestream, recruit an admin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All web conferencing software has a chat ability that people can use to ask questions (and horse around). Have you had the pleasure of being in a meeting where the person leading the meeting is also keeping one eye on the chats as they are trying to talk? It’s like watching a live PSA for not texting while driving. They might as well be doing vodka shots every slide of their presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recruit an admin. They’ll wrangle the chat area so that you can focus. That could involve the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing technical support to people who aren’t connecting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the interface to mute people with disruptive audio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answering clarifying questions that you’ve already covered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping track of the questions, organizing them, and sending them to you during the question period of your talk, or raising them immediately, as appropriate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pay it forward (or backwards)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got that one co-worker or friend who always helps you out of your technical jams, offer some sort of treat for their help. That person could be playing IT support for lots of people right now. Here are some ideas to pay it back or forward: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer some virtual babysitting by playing a game over webcam with their kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order them a Yum box subscription (provided they don’t have dietary restrictions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order them a gift delivery or curbside from their favorite local restaurant or bakery. You can surprise them by collaborating with their partner or roommate to figure out their tastes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send them a YouTube playlist to brighten their day&lt;/li&gt;

The wonderful thing about working from home, of  course, is that you’ve reduced your commute time to less than five minutes. But commutes are valuable parts of the day by helping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintain a boundary between work from home so that work doesn’t overrun your home life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you transition from work to home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep your entire day from blurring together by separating it into distinct parts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's keep the routine of a commute, but substitute something way more enjoyable than rush hour traffic. Before we get into the specifics of what you commute could include, let’s breeze through the parts of your routine that AREN’T your commute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your pre-commute morning routine roughly similar to what it was before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then do your morning community activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your ‘getting to work’ routine roughly the same. Don’t forget to take some time to connect with your co-workers on your company Slack (or other tool of choice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tidy your work area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make notes of where you left off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note any priorities for tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close everything up. You’re &lt;em&gt;DONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do your evening commute routine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the example ‘commutes’ below you might find better for the morning and others the evening. I highly recommend picking at least one exercise ‘commute’ per day. Not only will it keep your mental health stronger during these stressful times, but it will help keep you healthy in the event you catch COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to yourself and understand what you need at the end of the workday. Don't force, for example, a social commute if you're wiped out from meetings that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a walk, listening to podcasts, music, or audiobook similar to your normal commute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kick a ball around in the yard with your kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a 15-20 minute exercise routine on YouTube and repeat it daily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk or drive to the park (with your sanitizer) and play for a bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for a run, bike, or dust off that exercise equipment that’s grown a little lonely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a no-equipment HIIT workout like &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/gallery/hiit-cardio-workout"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Peaceful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditate using an app like Headspace or Insight Timer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a shower or bath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brew a cup of tea and sit outside with a book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Color&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedule a phone call or webcam conversation with a friend for each day of the week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start an actual email thread with an old friend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call an older relative of friend that you haven’t spoken to in ages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throw a virtual happy hour on Fridays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start playing a new game on your phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play hide and seek with your kids, partner, or housemates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play video games with your family and friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crack open a jigsaw puzzle (also great for conference calls!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a dance party in your living room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brainy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on learning a new language using an app like Duolingo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to a podcast like Futility Closet or Stuff You Should Know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solve a Sudoku, crossword, or other brain puzzle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up for a free course on something that’s always interested you on &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play that instrument you’ve been neglecting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crochet, knit, or sew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a model or play with legos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw or paint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you should have enough ideas to find whatever will make for a pleasant commute that scratches some sort of itch that your work doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry></feed>
