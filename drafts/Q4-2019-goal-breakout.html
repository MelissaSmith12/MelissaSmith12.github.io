</footer>    <div class="section"><p>Last week <strong>LINK</strong>, I wrote about the goals I plan to achieve by the end of 2019. The goals were still in a loosely defined state so that I could do a deeper dive this week into how I refine them.</p>
<p>Goals need to be specific and measurable. It's not just enough to say that I want to sleep better or by healthier. Having quantified goals help me know when my habits are moving me closer to success. And as often as possible, the goal needs to be something you can directly control. In other words, if you frame the goals as habits, that changes the focus of the experience. So, it might be tempting to have a goal of 'lose 10 pounds'. But any number of things could legitimately get in the way of that. Your metabolism could throw a hissy fit and refuse to budge. You could lose 10 pounds of fat but gain 10 pounds of muscle, so the scale doesn't budge, but you're clearly a much healtier person.</p>
<p>But, yeah. I really want to write down 'lose 10 pounds'. So let's use some different terminology. I propose two alternative terms for that kind of 'goal': 'expected result' and 'XXXXXXX inspiration'. </p>
<p>This is about tapping into the reward centers in your brain. We want to feel like we've succeeded. We want to celebrate our successes. </p>
<p>If your goals are framed this way, it also gives you a great diagnostic tool to take next steps. </p>
<p>I'll start with the easiest of the goals to quantify: sleep. I want to be DONE with my bout of insomnia. When I go to bed, I want to fall asleep within a reasonable time frame. I want to avoid nights where I completely screw up my schedule because I couldn't fall asleep until four, so I slept until noon. And it would probably be better for my health if I went to bed a little earlier than I currently do. But I'm not planning to magically change a lifetime of being an owl.</p>
<p>By the end of December 2019:
    Understand what factors make me have a good or bad night's sleep.
    Have an updated wind-down and bedtime routine that sets me up to fall asleep by 12:30.
    Stop using my snooze alarm.</p>
<p>Expected result: Most nights, I fall asleep by 12:30 and wake up no later than 9, getting an average of 8 hours of sleep per week.</p>
<p>Health is harder to pin down. Weight and BMI are two mechanisms I could definitely use as measures of health. But I can only influence my metabolism, not directly control it. So I want to create goals that ought to guide me in that direction. Additionally, BMI and weight are not the sum total of your health, and overall health is what I intend to focus on. I searched for other health metrics and found this handy guide which seems like a good start.</p>
<p>https://www.insider.com/how-to-measure-health-2017-9</p>
<p>Waist circumference is an expected result (not goal!) that I need to track based on my latest physical. I've got the sleep goal covered up above. That leaves two things on the list that could definitely use some attention: time spent moving and hydration. Despite the article's advice, for hydration I'm going to set a fixed intake goal. It's easier to track than a pee-chart, and I'm not sure the world really needs me to blog a pee chart.</p>
<p>By the end of December 2019:
    Regularly fill all of the hourly movement slots on my Fitbit.
    Finish the second season of Zombies Run, including all side missions (42 missions total - ~3 runs per week)
    Start doing long runs again on Saturdays, at least 4 by the end of December 2019.
    Limit foods with added refined sugar to twice a week.
    Meet weight-lifting goal to be determined by end of October.
    Drink an average of, at minimum, 64 oz. water per day.</p>
<p>Expected result: Reduce waist circumference by at least one inch.</p>
<p>So that leaves the most nebulous goal for last: developing a functional schedule. This one's a bit murky, and it may need to evolve over time. I know that I want to be scheduled enough that I keep my commitments to other people and can close up my computer at the end of the day, knowing that I've kept my commitments to myself. But I also want the freedom to take a full or partial day off when it suits me, not just because the calendar says it's a Saturday. And most importantly, I need some sort of structure so that I don't get overwhelmed by the quantity of choices about how I might spend my time (more on that sometime in the next month).</p>
<p>I did some quick poking around on the internet, and there's plenty of tips out there for time management for freelancers, but nothing that quite addresses what I need. The articles I saw reiterated things I knew or have tried in the past, like controlling for distractions and keeping bullet journals.</p>
<p>One of the things I've struggled with is that there are infinite ways I could organize my schedule. Also, I'm an owl and my husband is somewhat of a lark. There's something about my brain that lights up when it gets dark outside. My husband could give you an earful about my perpetual habit of starting deep conversations at around 10 pm. Going to sleep as late as we do is a compromise of sorts.</p>
<p>Getting my sleep schedule back in order will help anchor whatever schedule I create. </p>
<p>By the end of 2019:
    Keep a bullet journal to focus my day.
    Restrict my phone game-playing so that it's always paired with another activity.
    Get into rhythm/system/schedule for house cleaning, tidying, and maintance.
    Understand and write down what rhythm keeps me happiest and most fulfilled.
    Revisit and quantify additional specifics about this goal at the end of October.</p>
<p>Expected result: Gorgeously balanced life ;)</p>
<p>So that's it for now. Next week I'll start my first set of bite-sized weekly habits to get me moving towards these goals.</p></div>
